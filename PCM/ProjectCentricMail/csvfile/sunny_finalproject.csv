nothing is changing about your current settings or how your information is  
processed. rather, we’ve improved the way we describe our practices and how  
we explain the options you have to update, manage, export, and delete your  
data.

we’re making these updates as new data protection regulations come into  
effect in the european union, and we’re taking the opportunity to make  
improvements for google users around the world.

making our privacy policy easier to understand

simpler structure &amp; clearer language

we’ve improved the navigation and organization of the policy to make it  
easier to find what you’re looking for. we’ve also explained our practices  
in more detail and with clearer language.

new descriptive videos &amp; illustrations

often a visual description is easier to understand than text alone, so  
we’ve added short videos and illustrations throughout the policy.

embedded privacy controls

we’ve made it easier to jump to key settings directly from the policy,  
helping you make choices about your privacy.

the revised policy is available here  
<https:>  
and will take effect on may 25, 2018.

improving your privacy controls

within the past year, we updated my activity  
<https:>  
so that you can better access and manage the data in your google account.  
we also launched a redesigned dashboard  
<https:>,  
which allows you to easily see an overview of products you’re using and  
your data associated with them.

this month, we’ve updated our privacy checkup  
<https:>  
with new illustrations and examples to help you make more informed choices  
about your key privacy controls. and since we understand that your  
preferences may change over time, the new privacy checkup enables you to  
sign up for regular reminders to check your privacy settings.

this month, we’re updating our privacy policy to make it easier for you to  
understand what information we collect and why we collect it. we’ve also  
taken steps to improve our privacy checkup and other controls we provide to  
safeguard your data and protect your privacy.

nothing is changing about your current settings or how your information is  
processed. rather, we’ve improved the way we describe our practices and how  
we explain the options you have to update, manage, export, and delete your  
data.

we’re making these updates as new data protection regulations come into  
effect in the european union, and we’re taking the opportunity to make  
improvements for google users around the world.

making our privacy policy easier to understand

simpler structure &amp; clearer language

we’ve improved the navigation and organization of the policy to make it  
easier to find what you’re looking for. we’ve also explained our practices  
in more detail and with clearer language.

new descriptive videos &amp; illustrations

often a visual description is easier to understand than text alone, so  
we’ve added short videos and illustrations throughout the policy.

embedded privacy controls

we’ve made it easier to jump to key settings directly from the policy,  
helping you make choices about your privacy.

the revised policy is available here  
<https:>  
and will take effect on may 25, 2018.

improving your privacy controls

within the past year, we updated my activity  
<https:>  
so that you can better access and manage the data in your google account.  
we also launched a redesigned dashboard  
<https:>,  
which allows you to easily see an overview of products you’re using and  
your data associated with them.

this month, we’ve updated our privacy checkup  
<https:>  
with new illustrations and examples to help you make more informed choices  
about your key privacy controls. and since we understand that your  
preferences may change over time, the new privacy checkup enables you to  
sign up for regular reminders to check your privacy settings.

to learn more about these and other controls to manage your privacy, visit  
your google account

163635d90a916e2f,google <privacy-noreply@policies.google.com>,improvements to our privacy policy and privacy controls,2018-05-15,"Google 1998shrikantgadekar@gmail.com Updating Our Privacy Policy This month, we&#39;re updating our Privacy Policy to make it easier for you to understand what information we collect and why we collect","[<p>1998shrikantgadekar@gmail.com

this month, we’re updating our privacy policy to make it easier for you to  
understand what information we collect and why we collect it. we’ve also  
taken steps to improve our privacy checkup and other controls we provide to  
safeguard your data and protect your privacy.

nothing is changing about your current settings or how your information is  
processed. rather, we’ve improved the way we describe our practices and how  
we explain the options you have to update, manage, export, and delete your  
data.

we’re making these updates as new data protection regulations come into  
effect in the european union, and we’re taking the opportunity to make  
improvements for google users around the world.

making our privacy policy easier to understand

simpler structure &amp; clearer language

we’ve improved the navigation and organization of the policy to make it  
easier to find what you’re looking for. we’ve also explained our practices  
in more detail and with clearer language.

new descriptive videos &amp; illustrations

often a visual description is easier to understand than text alone, so  
we’ve added short videos and illustrations throughout the policy.

embedded privacy controls

we’ve made it easier to jump to key settings directly from the policy,  
helping you make choices about your privacy.

the revised policy is available here  
<https:>  
and will take effect on may 25, 2018.

improving your privacy controls

within the past year, we updated my activity  
<https:>  
so that you can better access and manage the data in your google account.  
we also launched a redesigned dashboard  
<https:>,  
which allows you to easily see an overview of products you’re using and  
your data associated with them.

this month, we’ve updated our privacy checkup  
<https:>  
with new illustrations and examples to help you make more informed choices

In fact, I&#39;ve found through working with","[<p>hi sunny khandare -

yesterday i told you about the #1 thing that people screw up in
their interviews: they don’t know what to do if they get stuck.

in fact, i’ve found through working with dozens of students that
many people don’t even know how to approach a new problem.
rather, they simply go into the interview and hope that a
solution magically appears to them.

this is not a good strategy.

if your interviewer knows what they’re doing, they will
specifically ask you a question where the solution is nonobvious.
that doesn’t mean you have to be a genius to be able to solve it,
but you do have to have a structured approach.

when you see a problem that you don’t recognize, what is your
plan? here are 10 strategies to keep in your back pocket in case
you get stuck during your interview.

------------------------------
1. find a brute force solution
------------------------------

there’s probably one reason above all others that causes
candidates to get stuck finding a solution: they try to
immediately find an optimal solution.

i’ve discussed starting with brute force solutions (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/reh8hoh5qdn7x/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuynl0zs1ies1iexrllmnvbs9icnv0zs1mb3jjzq== ) in the past, but it bears
repeating. it is very easy to go down different rabbit holes when
trying to find an optimal solution and finding a brute force
solution always gives you a grounded place to come back to. even
though it may not be a great solution, if you can’t find a better
solution, it gives you something to fall back on.

the brute force solution also gives you a jumping-off point to
optimize your code. with a brute force solution, it is often easy
to see places in which you are doing repeated work or otherwise
slowing down the execution.

after finding the brute force solution, you can use gayle
laackmann mcdowell’s bud optimization (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/8kuqhoh5gdk3k/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuc2xpzgvzagfyzs5uzxqvz2f5bguyl2nyywnraw5nlxrozs1pbnrlcnzpzxctc2tpbgxzlwnvzgluzy1zb2z0lxnrawxscy1wcm9kdwn0lw1hbmfnzw1lbnqtagfuzg91dhm= ), which stands for bottlenecks,
unnecessary work, and duplicated work. by identifying places in
your code that are slowing everything else down, you can find
ways in which to optimize the code.

for example, if you’re looping through an array and for each
element, you need to look up that element in another array, you
have an o(n * m) time complexity, if n and m are the lengths of
the two arrays. however, if you put the second array into a set,
you get a lookup time of o(1), so your time complexity improves
to o(n).

finding a brute force solution is incredibly valuable, because it
helps you understand the problem better and ensures that you have
a solution.

-------------------------------
2. fully understand the problem
-------------------------------

it is shocking to me how many people will start trying to solve
an interview problem without really understanding what they’re
supposed to do.

in fact, when evaluating new coaching clients, i always ask them
to simply print a linked list in reverse order. this should be a
very simple task, but many people miss the core directive, which
is to print the list. i often find people trying to return a
reversed list or other such things. however, that is not what i
am asking and can be significantly more difficult.

when problems are more complicated or confusing, i often find
that people will spend a few minutes trying to understand the
problem, but eventually give up and figure they’ll just start
solving it. that’s a critical mistake, though. how can you solve
a problem when you don’t know what you’re solving?

there are a couple things that you can do if you’re struggling to
understand a coding interview question. the first is to simply
ask more questions of your interviewer. ask them to show you an
example or clarify any specific points on which you’re unclear.
don’t feel bad about asking a lot of questions. it’s their job to
make you understand what to do.

you can also work through a few examples. look at what the inputs
and outputs are. what is the function signature going to be?
explicitly defining these parameters can be very helpful in
thinking about the problem. for example, if you’re writing a
recursive function, it’s way easier to figure out the base case
when you know what the return type should be.

-----------------------------------
3. work through the problem by hand
-----------------------------------

not sure how to solve the problem in a coding interview? well can
you solve the problem yourself without writing any code? if you
understand the problem thoroughly, you should be able to answer
it. and if you can solve it by hand, you can solve it with code.

let’s consider the example of determining whether a string is a
palindrome. say i give you the string “acaramanamaraca”. is it a
palindrome? go ahead and decide.

how did you solve it? did you compare the first and last letters,
then the second and the second-to-last and so on? did you reverse
the string and then compare them? there are several different
ways that you can determine if a string is a palindrome by hand.

and now that you’ve done it by hand, can you write code to do the
same thing? in the two example solutions that i described, i
basically explained an algorithm that you can use to solve this
problem by hand. and that means it’s easy to write code to solve
it.

the key with this technique is just to be as detailed and
specific as possible when solving it by hand. if you say “oh i
just know it’s a palindrome”, then that’s not very helpful. how
do you know? if you’re struggling to think about it, pick a
larger input to solve by hand. something that you can’t do in
your head.

for example, if i asked you to multiply two numbers, it would be
silly to use the example of 3*4, since presumably you have that
memorized from doing multiplication tables in elementary school.
a far better example would be 14235 * 2512. with this, it is very
unlikely that you’ll be able to do it in your head so you have to
write it out. this will help you identify the “algorithm” that
you’re using.

------------------------------------------------------
4. brainstorm different data structures and algorithms
------------------------------------------------------

sometimes the easiest way to approach a coding interview question
is to take different common solutions and see if any of them
apply. we can do exactly this in coding interviews by
brainstorming different data structures and algorithms and seeing
if any of them are a good fit for our problem.

let’s say that we have a problem that involves strings. for
example, maybe we want to all the strings in an array that have a
certain prefix. let’s brainstorm:

* just keep the strings in the array. we iterate through the
array and just check the prefix of each string.
* add all the strings to a hashmap with mappings for each
possible prefix. that might work but there are a lot of
possibilities.
* we could sort the array of strings. that might make things
easier.
* maybe we could do some sort of tree structure?
* speaking of trees, what if we used a trie?

from this basic brainstorm, we’ve come up with multiple valid
possibilities. in this case, the problem that we’re looking at
does have many possible solutions, so that’s to be expected. even
if we only had one way to solve the problem, though, this may
help elucidate ways in which we can approach it.

the key is that no idea is too dumb when you’re brainstorming.
you’re doing this in front of your interviewer, so the temptation
is to try and sound smart, but you can very easily shoot yourself
in the foot by doing this. if you filter yourself while
brainstorming, you may miss key insights.

put everything down on the whiteboard and then see if anything
jumps out at you. can you make any clear connections? this
technique is great for sparking ideas.

--------------------------------------------
5. consider all the information you’re given
--------------------------------------------

lots of times, our interviewers give us clues as to how we should
think about a problem. by giving us details about how the input
is formatted or any restrictions on the input, they are subtly
hinting at how to view the problem.

for example, let’s say that we wanted to find a value in a sorted
matrix. if we know that the rows and columns of the matrix are in
sorted order, that gives us a big clue for how we can solve the
problem.

without that information, we’re fairly limited in how we can
approach this problem. our best bet would be to just iterate over
every value in the matrix to see if the value we’re searching for
exists. however, we have a big clue, which is that our matrix is
sorted.

knowing the matrix is sorted, we have algorithms to help us deal
with that. there’s binary search and we can also consider other
properties of our matrix. for example, since both rows and
columns are sorted, if we pick an arbitrary cell [i, j], any cell
and is going to have a value less than cell [i, j].

from the information given, if you’re stuck, you can simply take
some time to extrapolate everything you can. if the array is
sorted, what does that mean? if the input is in tree format, how
can we use that to our advantage? look for these clues.

-----------------------
6. simplify the problem
-----------------------

my favorite types of problems to ask as an interviewer are
problems that have a lot of moving pieces. these force the
interviewee to consider not only each part of the problem, but
how all of the different components interact with each other.

as an interviewer, this is great because i get a better idea of
an interviewee’s mental model. as an interviewee, however, it can
be difficult. whenever you see a problem that has a lot of
different stuff going on, a good starting point is to consider a
simpler problem.

let’s say that we want to find the path through a matrix with the
greatest product. this is a moderately difficult problem, but it
is complicated even more if you consider that values in your
matrix can be negative. since multiplying negatives cancel each
other out, this problem gets pretty tricky pretty fast.

but here’s the thing. the solution is not fundamentally different
than solving the problem for only positive numbers. if you get
the solution for solely positive values, then it is relatively
easy to extend the solution to include negative numbers as well.

similar to first working through a brute force solution, solving
a simpler version of the problem gives you a really good starting
point from which to build out your solution. it is often simply a
matter of handling additional input values and adding some
conditionals. once you have the framework, this is easy to do.

------------------------------------------
7. break down the problem into subproblems
------------------------------------------

in addition to simplifying problems, you can also just ignore
parts of the problem when you’re initially coming up with a
solution. this is my favorite technique when people do it right.

when you are asked a problem and are trying to come up with a
solution, ask yourself the following question: “is there any
function that, if i had access to it, would make it significantly
easier to solve this problem?”

oftentimes, you will find that there is an obvious function that
dramatically simplifies the problem. consider the example of
printing a linked list in reverse order. there should be two
obvious functions that would simplify this problem:
reverselinkedlist() and printlinkedlist(). if we already had
these functions, our solution becomes trivial.

void printreversedlinkedlist(node linkedlist) {

linkedlist = reverselinkedlist(linkedlist);

printlinkedlist(linkedlist);

// optionally, we can reverse our linked list again to return
it to the original state

}

our code really can’t get much simpler than that. and now that we
have our top-level function laid out, we can focus on
implementing each of these functions individually. this won’t
necessarily be trivial – reversing a linked list is a bit tricky
– but it will be a hell of a lot easier than what we were doing
before.

the key with this technique is that by breaking down the problem
into smaller components, it is much easier to see how to solve
the problem. you can start by just assuming that you have a
function that does x. now you only have to worry about doing all
of the other things. this abstraction makes it much easier to
reason about the problem.

and this technique also has an ancillary benefit. if you don’t
finish writing all of the code, it is still clear that you know
what you’re doing. if you choose to use a helper function, you
should implement that last. by implementing the core code first,
it is clear you know what’s up, and if you run out of time to
implement the helper function, chances are that was something
that would be pretty easy to do anyway. this is a great way to
compensate for lack of time/speed in an interview.

-------------------
8. take a step back
-------------------

going down a rabbit hole is one of the easiest ways to get stuck
in a coding interview. however, it’s not always obvious in the
moment that you’ve even gone down a rabbit hole in the first
place. that’s why i recommend that whenever you find yourself
starting to get stuck in a coding interview, you take a moment to
step back and look at the big picture.

let’s say that we realize that we need a function that stores
value mappings. for example we have something like int -&gt; string.
our initial solution might be to create a hashmap to store these
values. that would seem to be the logical thing.

however, we later discover that all of the integer keys are each
of the values from 0-n and we are going to want to be able to
iterate over the keys in order. now our hashmap doesn’t seem so
great, right?

however, i can’t tell you how many people i see who will just
take what they already have and try and force it to work. they’re
trying to put a square peg in a round hole. you can do it, but
it’s a lot of work.

first they have to get a list of all of the keys in the hashmap,
then they have to sort it, and then they have to iterate over it.
and that’s not to mention the extra work of putting everything
into a hashmap in the first place.

if they just used an array, it would be so much easier.

however, this is not always obvious. we tend to think about
problems in an iterative way, building up to a solution. that
means that if we don’t stop to think carefully about what we’re
doing, we may end up doing a lot of unnecessary work.

taking a step back is simply taking a moment to think about what
we’re doing at a high level and confirming that it is, in fact,
the best way that we could be accomplishing that task. you may be
surprised how often you don’t realize that there is a vastly more
efficient approach.

------------------------------------
9. collaborate with your interviewer
------------------------------------

many people see interviewing as a battle. it’s you versus the
interviewer. you’re trying to get the job and they’re trying to
take it away from you. you want to succeed and they want you to
fail.

this is one of the most destructive things that you can think in
your interview. this is completely false and it can change the
tone of the interview to be combative, which isn’t fun for
anyone.

the truth is that your interviewer wants you to succeed. their
goal is simply to make sure that you meet the standards that the
company has. if they’re being hard on you it’s because they’re
trying to make absolutely sure.

when you’re stuck on a problem, you can get feedback from your
interviewer. the more you talk out loud in your interview, the
more they will already know what’s going on, too, so the more
they will be able to help you.

one of my favorite phrases to use in an interview is simply,
“does that sound good to you?” when i come up with a solution and
i’m not sure if it’s the best, i’ll ask that question, which
gives my interviewer two options.

* if i’ve found a decent solution, they can say yes and suggest
that i start coding it up. this way i don’t waste any unnecessary
time trying to come up with an even better solution.
* if they’re not happy with my solution, they can say no and
suggest that i think about it a little more. this is helpful too
because, without really giving a hint at all, they are saying
that i’m not quite there yet.

granted, not all interviewers are going to be quite so helpful,
but there is no harm in asking and it can make your life a lot
easier.

----------------
10. ask for help
----------------

i’ve included this last because it’s definitely a last resort.
most interviewers will mark you down for needing a hint in your
interview. however, if you’re stuck and not making progress, this
is better than just twiddling your thumbs. and it doesn’t
necessarily disqualify you from getting an offer.

when you’re really stuck and not able to proceed, you can just be
upfront with your interviewer. tell them that you’re a little
stuck and ask if they can give you a hint. chances are, they’ll
offer you up something that will help you keep moving in the
right direction.

the worst thing that you can do in your interview is to give up
rather than asking for help. in the real world, there are plenty
of opportunities to get help from others, but no company wants to
have a quitter on their team. if you just give up when faced with
a hard problem, that’s definitely not what they want.

you’re not going to use all of these strategies in every
interview. they’re simply not necessary.

sometimes you’ll see a really easy problem and you won’t need to
use any of them. sometimes you’ll get a really hard problem and
have to combine several strategies.

regardless of the specific interview question, though, knowing
these strategies will make you bulletproof against even the
toughest questions.

so i want you to do something right now. pick one of these
strategies and try it out for yourself right now. we went over a
ton of stuff today so start with just picking one. i guarantee
you’ll see a big difference.

best,

sam

p.s. do you get stuck on recursive problems? coding interview
mastery: recursion will be reopening next week so be sure to read
your emails if you don’t want to miss it.

In fact, I&#39;ve found through working with","[<p>hi sunny khandare -

yesterday i told you about the #1 thing that people screw up in
their interviews: they don’t know what to do if they get stuck.

in fact, i’ve found through working with dozens of students that
many people don’t even know how to approach a new problem.
rather, they simply go into the interview and hope that a
solution magically appears to them.

this is not a good strategy.

if your interviewer knows what they’re doing, they will
specifically ask you a question where the solution is nonobvious.
that doesn’t mean you have to be a genius to be able to solve it,
but you do have to have a structured approach.

when you see a problem that you don’t recognize, what is your
plan? here are 10 strategies to keep in your back pocket in case
you get stuck during your interview.

------------------------------
1. find a brute force solution
------------------------------

there’s probably one reason above all others that causes
candidates to get stuck finding a solution: they try to
immediately find an optimal solution.

i’ve discussed starting with brute force solutions (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/reh8hoh5qdn7x/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuynl0zs1ies1iexrllmnvbs9icnv0zs1mb3jjzq== ) in the past, but it bears
repeating. it is very easy to go down different rabbit holes when
trying to find an optimal solution and finding a brute force
solution always gives you a grounded place to come back to. even
though it may not be a great solution, if you can’t find a better
solution, it gives you something to fall back on.

the brute force solution also gives you a jumping-off point to
optimize your code. with a brute force solution, it is often easy
to see places in which you are doing repeated work or otherwise
slowing down the execution.

after finding the brute force solution, you can use gayle
laackmann mcdowell’s bud optimization (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/8kuqhoh5gdk3k/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuc2xpzgvzagfyzs5uzxqvz2f5bguyl2nyywnraw5nlxrozs1pbnrlcnzpzxctc2tpbgxzlwnvzgluzy1zb2z0lxnrawxscy1wcm9kdwn0lw1hbmfnzw1lbnqtagfuzg91dhm= ), which stands for bottlenecks,
unnecessary work, and duplicated work. by identifying places in
your code that are slowing everything else down, you can find
ways in which to optimize the code.

for example, if you’re looping through an array and for each
element, you need to look up that element in another array, you
have an o(n * m) time complexity, if n and m are the lengths of
the two arrays. however, if you put the second array into a set,
you get a lookup time of o(1), so your time complexity improves
to o(n).

finding a brute force solution is incredibly valuable, because it
helps you understand the problem better and ensures that you have
a solution.

-------------------------------
2. fully understand the problem
-------------------------------

it is shocking to me how many people will start trying to solve
an interview problem without really understanding what they’re
supposed to do.

in fact, when evaluating new coaching clients, i always ask them
to simply print a linked list in reverse order. this should be a
very simple task, but many people miss the core directive, which
is to print the list. i often find people trying to return a
reversed list or other such things. however, that is not what i
am asking and can be significantly more difficult.

when problems are more complicated or confusing, i often find
that people will spend a few minutes trying to understand the
problem, but eventually give up and figure they’ll just start
solving it. that’s a critical mistake, though. how can you solve
a problem when you don’t know what you’re solving?

there are a couple things that you can do if you’re struggling to
understand a coding interview question. the first is to simply
ask more questions of your interviewer. ask them to show you an
example or clarify any specific points on which you’re unclear.
don’t feel bad about asking a lot of questions. it’s their job to
make you understand what to do.

you can also work through a few examples. look at what the inputs
and outputs are. what is the function signature going to be?
explicitly defining these parameters can be very helpful in
thinking about the problem. for example, if you’re writing a
recursive function, it’s way easier to figure out the base case
when you know what the return type should be.

-----------------------------------
3. work through the problem by hand
-----------------------------------

not sure how to solve the problem in a coding interview? well can
you solve the problem yourself without writing any code? if you
understand the problem thoroughly, you should be able to answer
it. and if you can solve it by hand, you can solve it with code.

let’s consider the example of determining whether a string is a
palindrome. say i give you the string “acaramanamaraca”. is it a
palindrome? go ahead and decide.

how did you solve it? did you compare the first and last letters,
then the second and the second-to-last and so on? did you reverse
the string and then compare them? there are several different
ways that you can determine if a string is a palindrome by hand.

and now that you’ve done it by hand, can you write code to do the
same thing? in the two example solutions that i described, i
basically explained an algorithm that you can use to solve this
problem by hand. and that means it’s easy to write code to solve
it.

the key with this technique is just to be as detailed and
specific as possible when solving it by hand. if you say “oh i
just know it’s a palindrome”, then that’s not very helpful. how
do you know? if you’re struggling to think about it, pick a
larger input to solve by hand. something that you can’t do in
your head.

for example, if i asked you to multiply two numbers, it would be
silly to use the example of 3*4, since presumably you have that
memorized from doing multiplication tables in elementary school.
a far better example would be 14235 * 2512. with this, it is very
unlikely that you’ll be able to do it in your head so you have to
write it out. this will help you identify the “algorithm” that
you’re using.

------------------------------------------------------
4. brainstorm different data structures and algorithms
------------------------------------------------------

sometimes the easiest way to approach a coding interview question
is to take different common solutions and see if any of them
apply. we can do exactly this in coding interviews by
brainstorming different data structures and algorithms and seeing
if any of them are a good fit for our problem.

let’s say that we have a problem that involves strings. for
example, maybe we want to all the strings in an array that have a
certain prefix. let’s brainstorm:

* just keep the strings in the array. we iterate through the
array and just check the prefix of each string.
* add all the strings to a hashmap with mappings for each
possible prefix. that might work but there are a lot of
possibilities.
* we could sort the array of strings. that might make things
easier.
* maybe we could do some sort of tree structure?
* speaking of trees, what if we used a trie?

from this basic brainstorm, we’ve come up with multiple valid
possibilities. in this case, the problem that we’re looking at
does have many possible solutions, so that’s to be expected. even
if we only had one way to solve the problem, though, this may
help elucidate ways in which we can approach it.

the key is that no idea is too dumb when you’re brainstorming.
you’re doing this in front of your interviewer, so the temptation
is to try and sound smart, but you can very easily shoot yourself
in the foot by doing this. if you filter yourself while
brainstorming, you may miss key insights.

put everything down on the whiteboard and then see if anything
jumps out at you. can you make any clear connections? this
technique is great for sparking ideas.

--------------------------------------------
5. consider all the information you’re given
--------------------------------------------

lots of times, our interviewers give us clues as to how we should
think about a problem. by giving us details about how the input
is formatted or any restrictions on the input, they are subtly
hinting at how to view the problem.

for example, let’s say that we wanted to find a value in a sorted
matrix. if we know that the rows and columns of the matrix are in
sorted order, that gives us a big clue for how we can solve the
problem.

without that information, we’re fairly limited in how we can
approach this problem. our best bet would be to just iterate over
every value in the matrix to see if the value we’re searching for
exists. however, we have a big clue, which is that our matrix is
sorted.

knowing the matrix is sorted, we have algorithms to help us deal
with that. there’s binary search and we can also consider other
properties of our matrix. for example, since both rows and
columns are sorted, if we pick an arbitrary cell [i, j], any cell
and is going to have a value less than cell [i, j].

from the information given, if you’re stuck, you can simply take
some time to extrapolate everything you can. if the array is
sorted, what does that mean? if the input is in tree format, how
can we use that to our advantage? look for these clues.

-----------------------
6. simplify the problem
-----------------------

my favorite types of problems to ask as an interviewer are
problems that have a lot of moving pieces. these force the
interviewee to consider not only each part of the problem, but
how all of the different components interact with each other.

as an interviewer, this is great because i get a better idea of
an interviewee’s mental model. as an interviewee, however, it can
be difficult. whenever you see a problem that has a lot of
different stuff going on, a good starting point is to consider a
simpler problem.

let’s say that we want to find the path through a matrix with the
greatest product. this is a moderately difficult problem, but it
is complicated even more if you consider that values in your
matrix can be negative. since multiplying negatives cancel each
other out, this problem gets pretty tricky pretty fast.

but here’s the thing. the solution is not fundamentally different
than solving the problem for only positive numbers. if you get
the solution for solely positive values, then it is relatively
easy to extend the solution to include negative numbers as well.

similar to first working through a brute force solution, solving
a simpler version of the problem gives you a really good starting
point from which to build out your solution. it is often simply a
matter of handling additional input values and adding some
conditionals. once you have the framework, this is easy to do.

------------------------------------------
7. break down the problem into subproblems
------------------------------------------

in addition to simplifying problems, you can also just ignore
parts of the problem when you’re initially coming up with a
solution. this is my favorite technique when people do it right.

when you are asked a problem and are trying to come up with a
solution, ask yourself the following question: “is there any
function that, if i had access to it, would make it significantly
easier to solve this problem?”

oftentimes, you will find that there is an obvious function that
dramatically simplifies the problem. consider the example of
printing a linked list in reverse order. there should be two
obvious functions that would simplify this problem:
reverselinkedlist() and printlinkedlist(). if we already had
these functions, our solution becomes trivial.

void printreversedlinkedlist(node linkedlist) {

linkedlist = reverselinkedlist(linkedlist);

printlinkedlist(linkedlist);

// optionally, we can reverse our linked list again to return
it to the original state

}

our code really can’t get much simpler than that. and now that we
have our top-level function laid out, we can focus on
implementing each of these functions individually. this won’t
necessarily be trivial – reversing a linked list is a bit tricky
– but it will be a hell of a lot easier than what we were doing
before.

the key with this technique is that by breaking down the problem
into smaller components, it is much easier to see how to solve
the problem. you can start by just assuming that you have a
function that does x. now you only have to worry about doing all
of the other things. this abstraction makes it much easier to
reason about the problem.

and this technique also has an ancillary benefit. if you don’t
finish writing all of the code, it is still clear that you know
what you’re doing. if you choose to use a helper function, you
should implement that last. by implementing the core code first,
it is clear you know what’s up, and if you run out of time to
implement the helper function, chances are that was something
that would be pretty easy to do anyway. this is a great way to
compensate for lack of time/speed in an interview.

-------------------
8. take a step back
-------------------

going down a rabbit hole is one of the easiest ways to get stuck
in a coding interview. however, it’s not always obvious in the
moment that you’ve even gone down a rabbit hole in the first
place. that’s why i recommend that whenever you find yourself
starting to get stuck in a coding interview, you take a moment to
step back and look at the big picture.

let’s say that we realize that we need a function that stores
value mappings. for example we have something like int -&gt; string.
our initial solution might be to create a hashmap to store these
values. that would seem to be the logical thing.

however, we later discover that all of the integer keys are each
of the values from 0-n and we are going to want to be able to
iterate over the keys in order. now our hashmap doesn’t seem so
great, right?

however, i can’t tell you how many people i see who will just
take what they already have and try and force it to work. they’re
trying to put a square peg in a round hole. you can do it, but
it’s a lot of work.

first they have to get a list of all of the keys in the hashmap,
then they have to sort it, and then they have to iterate over it.
and that’s not to mention the extra work of putting everything
into a hashmap in the first place.

if they just used an array, it would be so much easier.

however, this is not always obvious. we tend to think about
problems in an iterative way, building up to a solution. that
means that if we don’t stop to think carefully about what we’re
doing, we may end up doing a lot of unnecessary work.

taking a step back is simply taking a moment to think about what
we’re doing at a high level and confirming that it is, in fact,
the best way that we could be accomplishing that task. you may be
surprised how often you don’t realize that there is a vastly more
efficient approach.

------------------------------------
9. collaborate with your interviewer
------------------------------------

many people see interviewing as a battle. it’s you versus the
interviewer. you’re trying to get the job and they’re trying to
take it away from you. you want to succeed and they want you to
fail.

this is one of the most destructive things that you can think in
your interview. this is completely false and it can change the
tone of the interview to be combative, which isn’t fun for
anyone.

the truth is that your interviewer wants you to succeed. their
goal is simply to make sure that you meet the standards that the
company has. if they’re being hard on you it’s because they’re
trying to make absolutely sure.

when you’re stuck on a problem, you can get feedback from your
interviewer. the more you talk out loud in your interview, the
more they will already know what’s going on, too, so the more
they will be able to help you.

one of my favorite phrases to use in an interview is simply,
“does that sound good to you?” when i come up with a solution and
i’m not sure if it’s the best, i’ll ask that question, which
gives my interviewer two options.

* if i’ve found a decent solution, they can say yes and suggest
that i start coding it up. this way i don’t waste any unnecessary
time trying to come up with an even better solution.
* if they’re not happy with my solution, they can say no and
suggest that i think about it a little more. this is helpful too
because, without really giving a hint at all, they are saying
that i’m not quite there yet.

granted, not all interviewers are going to be quite so helpful,
but there is no harm in asking and it can make your life a lot
easier.

----------------
10. ask for help
----------------

i’ve included this last because it’s definitely a last resort.
most interviewers will mark you down for needing a hint in your
interview. however, if you’re stuck and not making progress, this
is better than just twiddling your thumbs. and it doesn’t
necessarily disqualify you from getting an offer.

when you’re really stuck and not able to proceed, you can just be
upfront with your interviewer. tell them that you’re a little
stuck and ask if they can give you a hint. chances are, they’ll
offer you up something that will help you keep moving in the
right direction.

the worst thing that you can do in your interview is to give up
rather than asking for help. in the real world, there are plenty
of opportunities to get help from others, but no company wants to
have a quitter on their team. if you just give up when faced with
a hard problem, that’s definitely not what they want.

you’re not going to use all of these strategies in every
interview. they’re simply not necessary.

sometimes you’ll see a really easy problem and you won’t need to
use any of them. sometimes you’ll get a really hard problem and
have to combine several strategies.

regardless of the specific interview question, though, knowing
these strategies will make you bulletproof against even the
toughest questions.

so i want you to do something right now. pick one of these
strategies and try it out for yourself right now. we went over a
ton of stuff today so start with just picking one. i guarantee
you’ll see a big difference.

best,

sam

In fact, I&#39;ve found through working with","[<p>hi sunny khandare -

yesterday i told you about the #1 thing that people screw up in
their interviews: they don’t know what to do if they get stuck.

in fact, i’ve found through working with dozens of students that
many people don’t even know how to approach a new problem.
rather, they simply go into the interview and hope that a
solution magically appears to them.

this is not a good strategy.

if your interviewer knows what they’re doing, they will
specifically ask you a question where the solution is nonobvious.
that doesn’t mean you have to be a genius to be able to solve it,
but you do have to have a structured approach.

when you see a problem that you don’t recognize, what is your
plan? here are 10 strategies to keep in your back pocket in case
you get stuck during your interview.

------------------------------
1. find a brute force solution
------------------------------

there’s probably one reason above all others that causes
candidates to get stuck finding a solution: they try to
immediately find an optimal solution.

i’ve discussed starting with brute force solutions (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/reh8hoh5qdn7x/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuynl0zs1ies1iexrllmnvbs9icnv0zs1mb3jjzq== ) in the past, but it bears
repeating. it is very easy to go down different rabbit holes when
trying to find an optimal solution and finding a brute force
solution always gives you a grounded place to come back to. even
though it may not be a great solution, if you can’t find a better
solution, it gives you something to fall back on.

the brute force solution also gives you a jumping-off point to
optimize your code. with a brute force solution, it is often easy
to see places in which you are doing repeated work or otherwise
slowing down the execution.

after finding the brute force solution, you can use gayle
laackmann mcdowell’s bud optimization (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/8kuqhoh5gdk3k/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuc2xpzgvzagfyzs5uzxqvz2f5bguyl2nyywnraw5nlxrozs1pbnrlcnzpzxctc2tpbgxzlwnvzgluzy1zb2z0lxnrawxscy1wcm9kdwn0lw1hbmfnzw1lbnqtagfuzg91dhm= ), which stands for bottlenecks,
unnecessary work, and duplicated work. by identifying places in
your code that are slowing everything else down, you can find
ways in which to optimize the code.

for example, if you’re looping through an array and for each
element, you need to look up that element in another array, you
have an o(n * m) time complexity, if n and m are the lengths of
the two arrays. however, if you put the second array into a set,
you get a lookup time of o(1), so your time complexity improves
to o(n).

finding a brute force solution is incredibly valuable, because it
helps you understand the problem better and ensures that you have
a solution.

-------------------------------
2. fully understand the problem
-------------------------------

it is shocking to me how many people will start trying to solve
an interview problem without really understanding what they’re
supposed to do.

in fact, when evaluating new coaching clients, i always ask them
to simply print a linked list in reverse order. this should be a
very simple task, but many people miss the core directive, which
is to print the list. i often find people trying to return a
reversed list or other such things. however, that is not what i
am asking and can be significantly more difficult.

when problems are more complicated or confusing, i often find
that people will spend a few minutes trying to understand the
problem, but eventually give up and figure they’ll just start
solving it. that’s a critical mistake, though. how can you solve
a problem when you don’t know what you’re solving?

there are a couple things that you can do if you’re struggling to
understand a coding interview question. the first is to simply
ask more questions of your interviewer. ask them to show you an
example or clarify any specific points on which you’re unclear.
don’t feel bad about asking a lot of questions. it’s their job to
make you understand what to do.

you can also work through a few examples. look at what the inputs
and outputs are. what is the function signature going to be?
explicitly defining these parameters can be very helpful in
thinking about the problem. for example, if you’re writing a
recursive function, it’s way easier to figure out the base case
when you know what the return type should be.

-----------------------------------
3. work through the problem by hand
-----------------------------------

not sure how to solve the problem in a coding interview? well can
you solve the problem yourself without writing any code? if you
understand the problem thoroughly, you should be able to answer
it. and if you can solve it by hand, you can solve it with code.

let’s consider the example of determining whether a string is a
palindrome. say i give you the string “acaramanamaraca”. is it a
palindrome? go ahead and decide.

how did you solve it? did you compare the first and last letters,
then the second and the second-to-last and so on? did you reverse
the string and then compare them? there are several different
ways that you can determine if a string is a palindrome by hand.

and now that you’ve done it by hand, can you write code to do the
same thing? in the two example solutions that i described, i
basically explained an algorithm that you can use to solve this
problem by hand. and that means it’s easy to write code to solve
it.

the key with this technique is just to be as detailed and
specific as possible when solving it by hand. if you say “oh i
just know it’s a palindrome”, then that’s not very helpful. how
do you know? if you’re struggling to think about it, pick a
larger input to solve by hand. something that you can’t do in
your head.

for example, if i asked you to multiply two numbers, it would be
silly to use the example of 3*4, since presumably you have that
memorized from doing multiplication tables in elementary school.
a far better example would be 14235 * 2512. with this, it is very
unlikely that you’ll be able to do it in your head so you have to
write it out. this will help you identify the “algorithm” that
you’re using.

------------------------------------------------------
4. brainstorm different data structures and algorithms
------------------------------------------------------

sometimes the easiest way to approach a coding interview question
is to take different common solutions and see if any of them
apply. we can do exactly this in coding interviews by
brainstorming different data structures and algorithms and seeing
if any of them are a good fit for our problem.

let’s say that we have a problem that involves strings. for
example, maybe we want to all the strings in an array that have a
certain prefix. let’s brainstorm:

* just keep the strings in the array. we iterate through the
array and just check the prefix of each string.
* add all the strings to a hashmap with mappings for each
possible prefix. that might work but there are a lot of
possibilities.
* we could sort the array of strings. that might make things
easier.
* maybe we could do some sort of tree structure?
* speaking of trees, what if we used a trie?

from this basic brainstorm, we’ve come up with multiple valid
possibilities. in this case, the problem that we’re looking at
does have many possible solutions, so that’s to be expected. even
if we only had one way to solve the problem, though, this may
help elucidate ways in which we can approach it.

the key is that no idea is too dumb when you’re brainstorming.
you’re doing this in front of your interviewer, so the temptation
is to try and sound smart, but you can very easily shoot yourself
in the foot by doing this. if you filter yourself while
brainstorming, you may miss key insights.

put everything down on the whiteboard and then see if anything
jumps out at you. can you make any clear connections? this
technique is great for sparking ideas.

--------------------------------------------
5. consider all the information you’re given
--------------------------------------------

lots of times, our interviewers give us clues as to how we should
think about a problem. by giving us details about how the input
is formatted or any restrictions on the input, they are subtly
hinting at how to view the problem.

for example, let’s say that we wanted to find a value in a sorted
matrix. if we know that the rows and columns of the matrix are in
sorted order, that gives us a big clue for how we can solve the
problem.

without that information, we’re fairly limited in how we can
approach this problem. our best bet would be to just iterate over
every value in the matrix to see if the value we’re searching for
exists. however, we have a big clue, which is that our matrix is
sorted.

knowing the matrix is sorted, we have algorithms to help us deal
with that. there’s binary search and we can also consider other
properties of our matrix. for example, since both rows and
columns are sorted, if we pick an arbitrary cell [i, j], any cell
and is going to have a value less than cell [i, j].

from the information given, if you’re stuck, you can simply take
some time to extrapolate everything you can. if the array is
sorted, what does that mean? if the input is in tree format, how
can we use that to our advantage? look for these clues.

-----------------------
6. simplify the problem
-----------------------

my favorite types of problems to ask as an interviewer are
problems that have a lot of moving pieces. these force the
interviewee to consider not only each part of the problem, but
how all of the different components interact with each other.

as an interviewer, this is great because i get a better idea of
an interviewee’s mental model. as an interviewee, however, it can
be difficult. whenever you see a problem that has a lot of
different stuff going on, a good starting point is to consider a
simpler problem.

let’s say that we want to find the path through a matrix with the
greatest product. this is a moderately difficult problem, but it
is complicated even more if you consider that values in your
matrix can be negative. since multiplying negatives cancel each
other out, this problem gets pretty tricky pretty fast.

but here’s the thing. the solution is not fundamentally different
than solving the problem for only positive numbers. if you get
the solution for solely positive values, then it is relatively
easy to extend the solution to include negative numbers as well.

similar to first working through a brute force solution, solving
a simpler version of the problem gives you a really good starting
point from which to build out your solution. it is often simply a
matter of handling additional input values and adding some
conditionals. once you have the framework, this is easy to do.

------------------------------------------
7. break down the problem into subproblems
------------------------------------------

in addition to simplifying problems, you can also just ignore
parts of the problem when you’re initially coming up with a
solution. this is my favorite technique when people do it right.

when you are asked a problem and are trying to come up with a
solution, ask yourself the following question: “is there any
function that, if i had access to it, would make it significantly
easier to solve this problem?”

oftentimes, you will find that there is an obvious function that
dramatically simplifies the problem. consider the example of
printing a linked list in reverse order. there should be two
obvious functions that would simplify this problem:
reverselinkedlist() and printlinkedlist(). if we already had
these functions, our solution becomes trivial.

void printreversedlinkedlist(node linkedlist) {

linkedlist = reverselinkedlist(linkedlist);

printlinkedlist(linkedlist);

// optionally, we can reverse our linked list again to return
it to the original state

}

our code really can’t get much simpler than that. and now that we
have our top-level function laid out, we can focus on
implementing each of these functions individually. this won’t
necessarily be trivial – reversing a linked list is a bit tricky
– but it will be a hell of a lot easier than what we were doing
before.

the key with this technique is that by breaking down the problem
into smaller components, it is much easier to see how to solve
the problem. you can start by just assuming that you have a
function that does x. now you only have to worry about doing all
of the other things. this abstraction makes it much easier to
reason about the problem.

and this technique also has an ancillary benefit. if you don’t
finish writing all of the code, it is still clear that you know
what you’re doing. if you choose to use a helper function, you
should implement that last. by implementing the core code first,
it is clear you know what’s up, and if you run out of time to
implement the helper function, chances are that was something
that would be pretty easy to do anyway. this is a great way to
compensate for lack of time/speed in an interview.

-------------------
8. take a step back
-------------------

going down a rabbit hole is one of the easiest ways to get stuck
in a coding interview. however, it’s not always obvious in the
moment that you’ve even gone down a rabbit hole in the first
place. that’s why i recommend that whenever you find yourself
starting to get stuck in a coding interview, you take a moment to
step back and look at the big picture.

let’s say that we realize that we need a function that stores
value mappings. for example we have something like int -&gt; string.
our initial solution might be to create a hashmap to store these
values. that would seem to be the logical thing.

however, we later discover that all of the integer keys are each
of the values from 0-n and we are going to want to be able to
iterate over the keys in order. now our hashmap doesn’t seem so
great, right?

however, i can’t tell you how many people i see who will just
take what they already have and try and force it to work. they’re
trying to put a square peg in a round hole. you can do it, but
it’s a lot of work.

first they have to get a list of all of the keys in the hashmap,
then they have to sort it, and then they have to iterate over it.
and that’s not to mention the extra work of putting everything
into a hashmap in the first place.

if they just used an array, it would be so much easier.

however, this is not always obvious. we tend to think about
problems in an iterative way, building up to a solution. that
means that if we don’t stop to think carefully about what we’re
doing, we may end up doing a lot of unnecessary work.

taking a step back is simply taking a moment to think about what
we’re doing at a high level and confirming that it is, in fact,
the best way that we could be accomplishing that task. you may be
surprised how often you don’t realize that there is a vastly more
efficient approach.

------------------------------------
9. collaborate with your interviewer
------------------------------------

many people see interviewing as a battle. it’s you versus the
interviewer. you’re trying to get the job and they’re trying to
take it away from you. you want to succeed and they want you to
fail.

this is one of the most destructive things that you can think in
your interview. this is completely false and it can change the
tone of the interview to be combative, which isn’t fun for
anyone.

the truth is that your interviewer wants you to succeed. their
goal is simply to make sure that you meet the standards that the
company has. if they’re being hard on you it’s because they’re
trying to make absolutely sure.

when you’re stuck on a problem, you can get feedback from your
interviewer. the more you talk out loud in your interview, the
more they will already know what’s going on, too, so the more
they will be able to help you.

one of my favorite phrases to use in an interview is simply,
“does that sound good to you?” when i come up with a solution and
i’m not sure if it’s the best, i’ll ask that question, which
gives my interviewer two options.

* if i’ve found a decent solution, they can say yes and suggest
that i start coding it up. this way i don’t waste any unnecessary
time trying to come up with an even better solution.
* if they’re not happy with my solution, they can say no and
suggest that i think about it a little more. this is helpful too
because, without really giving a hint at all, they are saying
that i’m not quite there yet.

granted, not all interviewers are going to be quite so helpful,
but there is no harm in asking and it can make your life a lot
easier.

----------------
10. ask for help
----------------

i’ve included this last because it’s definitely a last resort.
most interviewers will mark you down for needing a hint in your
interview. however, if you’re stuck and not making progress, this
is better than just twiddling your thumbs. and it doesn’t
necessarily disqualify you from getting an offer.

when you’re really stuck and not able to proceed, you can just be
upfront with your interviewer. tell them that you’re a little
stuck and ask if they can give you a hint. chances are, they’ll
offer you up something that will help you keep moving in the
right direction.

the worst thing that you can do in your interview is to give up
rather than asking for help. in the real world, there are plenty
of opportunities to get help from others, but no company wants to
have a quitter on their team. if you just give up when faced with
a hard problem, that’s definitely not what they want.

you’re not going to use all of these strategies in every
interview. they’re simply not necessary.

sometimes you’ll see a really easy problem and you won’t need to
use any of them. sometimes you’ll get a really hard problem and
have to combine several strategies.

regardless of the specific interview question, though, knowing
these strategies will make you bulletproof against even the
toughest questions.

so i want you to do something right now. pick one of these
strategies and try it out for yourself right now. we went over a
ton of stuff today so start with just picking one. i guarantee
you’ll see a big difference.

best,

sam

every day, i talk to people about careers in software
engineering. whether via email with a new subscriber to this list
or someone who has been around for the last year and a half, or
in person with one of my coaching clients, i see all different
shades of software engineers.

however, every single software engineer that i talk to aspires to
the same thing: a job at a great company.

i love this. there are so many places on the internet that
attract software engineers that just want a job to get by.

here’s a reddit post from a year ago:

(if you don't see images below, click ""display images"")

( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/7qh7h8h8qdzzk/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuynl0zs1ies1iexrllmnvbs9jaw0tzhluyw1pyy1wcm9ncmftbwluzy8= )

i find posts like this fascinating because of how they tend to
polarize people. on forums like reddit, there are posts like
this, from someone who obviously gets the value of having a
meaningful job, and then there are lots comments of jealousy from
people wishing that they could have a job like that where they
don’t have to do any work.

i love the readers of byte by byte because you don’t think that
way. you know what you really want, whether it’s a big 4 or a hot
startup. my job is just to show you how to get there.

however, here’s the problem. just knowing what you want is not
enough. there are tons of people out there gunning for the same
jobs. while the number is probably a little skewed down, google
has an acceptance rate of ~1%. that means out of 100
interviewees, you need to be the best.

when you’re interviewing at companies like google, just having a
vague understanding of a topic isn’t going to cut it. you need to
understand every topic backwards and forwards.

this is why i created coding interview mastery: dynamic
programming ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/75u7h8hp6o56g/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ). after seeing so many
of my students putting in tons of effort only to still fail, i
wanted to ensure that there was a better way to learn dynamic
programming.

only to realize you’ve barely made a dent in it and you can still

https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/o2ikhqhl6rd6z/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ) takes everything that you need to
know for your interview and packages in such a way that you can
not only quickly understand it, but easily remember it in the
heat of the interview.

if you’re serious about interviewing, you’re going to put in many
hours into studying and preparing. however, even with all the
hours you’re putting in, there are so many different topics that
it’s not like you’re actually spending a whole lot of time on any
one.

when you spend weeks on dynamic programming, that’s time that
you’re taking away from other topics that you need to study.
remember that you need to be very strong on every topic to get
the job at google.

ultimately, as i talked about last week, this is an opportunity
to invest in yourself. while no one is forcing you to do so,
recognize how not making this investment will affect your life.
you will continue studying dynamic programming. maybe you’ll
figure it out. maybe you won’t. maybe you’ll get the job. maybe
you won’t.

but regardless of the outcome, you will invest large amounts of
your time. time that no amount of money can bring back. chances
are, you’ll realize later that you actually needed this course,
and you’ll have wasted time and then still spend the money to
purchase the course.

this is why you should invest in this course today (

longer you put it off, the more time you waste.

if you’re ready to get the job you’ve dreamed of and nail dynamic
programming once and for all, join the course here. (

In fact, I&#39;ve found through working with","[<p>hi sunny khandare -

yesterday i told you about the #1 thing that people screw up in
their interviews: they don’t know what to do if they get stuck.

in fact, i’ve found through working with dozens of students that
many people don’t even know how to approach a new problem.
rather, they simply go into the interview and hope that a
solution magically appears to them.

this is not a good strategy.

if your interviewer knows what they’re doing, they will
specifically ask you a question where the solution is nonobvious.
that doesn’t mean you have to be a genius to be able to solve it,
but you do have to have a structured approach.

when you see a problem that you don’t recognize, what is your
plan? here are 10 strategies to keep in your back pocket in case
you get stuck during your interview.

------------------------------
1. find a brute force solution
------------------------------

there’s probably one reason above all others that causes
candidates to get stuck finding a solution: they try to
immediately find an optimal solution.

i’ve discussed starting with brute force solutions (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/reh8hoh5qdn7x/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuynl0zs1ies1iexrllmnvbs9icnv0zs1mb3jjzq== ) in the past, but it bears
repeating. it is very easy to go down different rabbit holes when
trying to find an optimal solution and finding a brute force
solution always gives you a grounded place to come back to. even
though it may not be a great solution, if you can’t find a better
solution, it gives you something to fall back on.

the brute force solution also gives you a jumping-off point to
optimize your code. with a brute force solution, it is often easy
to see places in which you are doing repeated work or otherwise
slowing down the execution.

after finding the brute force solution, you can use gayle
laackmann mcdowell’s bud optimization (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/8kuqhoh5gdk3k/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuc2xpzgvzagfyzs5uzxqvz2f5bguyl2nyywnraw5nlxrozs1pbnrlcnzpzxctc2tpbgxzlwnvzgluzy1zb2z0lxnrawxscy1wcm9kdwn0lw1hbmfnzw1lbnqtagfuzg91dhm= ), which stands for bottlenecks,
unnecessary work, and duplicated work. by identifying places in
your code that are slowing everything else down, you can find
ways in which to optimize the code.

for example, if you’re looping through an array and for each
element, you need to look up that element in another array, you
have an o(n * m) time complexity, if n and m are the lengths of
the two arrays. however, if you put the second array into a set,
you get a lookup time of o(1), so your time complexity improves
to o(n).

finding a brute force solution is incredibly valuable, because it
helps you understand the problem better and ensures that you have
a solution.

-------------------------------
2. fully understand the problem
-------------------------------

it is shocking to me how many people will start trying to solve
an interview problem without really understanding what they’re
supposed to do.

in fact, when evaluating new coaching clients, i always ask them
to simply print a linked list in reverse order. this should be a
very simple task, but many people miss the core directive, which
is to print the list. i often find people trying to return a
reversed list or other such things. however, that is not what i
am asking and can be significantly more difficult.

when problems are more complicated or confusing, i often find
that people will spend a few minutes trying to understand the
problem, but eventually give up and figure they’ll just start
solving it. that’s a critical mistake, though. how can you solve
a problem when you don’t know what you’re solving?

there are a couple things that you can do if you’re struggling to
understand a coding interview question. the first is to simply
ask more questions of your interviewer. ask them to show you an
example or clarify any specific points on which you’re unclear.
don’t feel bad about asking a lot of questions. it’s their job to
make you understand what to do.

you can also work through a few examples. look at what the inputs
and outputs are. what is the function signature going to be?
explicitly defining these parameters can be very helpful in
thinking about the problem. for example, if you’re writing a
recursive function, it’s way easier to figure out the base case
when you know what the return type should be.

-----------------------------------
3. work through the problem by hand
-----------------------------------

not sure how to solve the problem in a coding interview? well can
you solve the problem yourself without writing any code? if you
understand the problem thoroughly, you should be able to answer
it. and if you can solve it by hand, you can solve it with code.

let’s consider the example of determining whether a string is a
palindrome. say i give you the string “acaramanamaraca”. is it a
palindrome? go ahead and decide.

how did you solve it? did you compare the first and last letters,
then the second and the second-to-last and so on? did you reverse
the string and then compare them? there are several different
ways that you can determine if a string is a palindrome by hand.

and now that you’ve done it by hand, can you write code to do the
same thing? in the two example solutions that i described, i
basically explained an algorithm that you can use to solve this
problem by hand. and that means it’s easy to write code to solve
it.

the key with this technique is just to be as detailed and
specific as possible when solving it by hand. if you say “oh i
just know it’s a palindrome”, then that’s not very helpful. how
do you know? if you’re struggling to think about it, pick a
larger input to solve by hand. something that you can’t do in
your head.

for example, if i asked you to multiply two numbers, it would be
silly to use the example of 3*4, since presumably you have that
memorized from doing multiplication tables in elementary school.
a far better example would be 14235 * 2512. with this, it is very
unlikely that you’ll be able to do it in your head so you have to
write it out. this will help you identify the “algorithm” that
you’re using.

------------------------------------------------------
4. brainstorm different data structures and algorithms
------------------------------------------------------

sometimes the easiest way to approach a coding interview question
is to take different common solutions and see if any of them
apply. we can do exactly this in coding interviews by
brainstorming different data structures and algorithms and seeing
if any of them are a good fit for our problem.

let’s say that we have a problem that involves strings. for
example, maybe we want to all the strings in an array that have a
certain prefix. let’s brainstorm:

* just keep the strings in the array. we iterate through the
array and just check the prefix of each string.
* add all the strings to a hashmap with mappings for each
possible prefix. that might work but there are a lot of
possibilities.
* we could sort the array of strings. that might make things
easier.
* maybe we could do some sort of tree structure?
* speaking of trees, what if we used a trie?

from this basic brainstorm, we’ve come up with multiple valid
possibilities. in this case, the problem that we’re looking at
does have many possible solutions, so that’s to be expected. even
if we only had one way to solve the problem, though, this may
help elucidate ways in which we can approach it.

the key is that no idea is too dumb when you’re brainstorming.
you’re doing this in front of your interviewer, so the temptation
is to try and sound smart, but you can very easily shoot yourself
in the foot by doing this. if you filter yourself while
brainstorming, you may miss key insights.

put everything down on the whiteboard and then see if anything
jumps out at you. can you make any clear connections? this
technique is great for sparking ideas.

--------------------------------------------
5. consider all the information you’re given
--------------------------------------------

lots of times, our interviewers give us clues as to how we should
think about a problem. by giving us details about how the input
is formatted or any restrictions on the input, they are subtly
hinting at how to view the problem.

for example, let’s say that we wanted to find a value in a sorted
matrix. if we know that the rows and columns of the matrix are in
sorted order, that gives us a big clue for how we can solve the
problem.

without that information, we’re fairly limited in how we can
approach this problem. our best bet would be to just iterate over
every value in the matrix to see if the value we’re searching for
exists. however, we have a big clue, which is that our matrix is
sorted.

knowing the matrix is sorted, we have algorithms to help us deal
with that. there’s binary search and we can also consider other
properties of our matrix. for example, since both rows and
columns are sorted, if we pick an arbitrary cell [i, j], any cell
and is going to have a value less than cell [i, j].

from the information given, if you’re stuck, you can simply take
some time to extrapolate everything you can. if the array is
sorted, what does that mean? if the input is in tree format, how
can we use that to our advantage? look for these clues.

-----------------------
6. simplify the problem
-----------------------

my favorite types of problems to ask as an interviewer are
problems that have a lot of moving pieces. these force the
interviewee to consider not only each part of the problem, but
how all of the different components interact with each other.

as an interviewer, this is great because i get a better idea of
an interviewee’s mental model. as an interviewee, however, it can
be difficult. whenever you see a problem that has a lot of
different stuff going on, a good starting point is to consider a
simpler problem.

let’s say that we want to find the path through a matrix with the
greatest product. this is a moderately difficult problem, but it
is complicated even more if you consider that values in your
matrix can be negative. since multiplying negatives cancel each
other out, this problem gets pretty tricky pretty fast.

but here’s the thing. the solution is not fundamentally different
than solving the problem for only positive numbers. if you get
the solution for solely positive values, then it is relatively
easy to extend the solution to include negative numbers as well.

similar to first working through a brute force solution, solving
a simpler version of the problem gives you a really good starting
point from which to build out your solution. it is often simply a
matter of handling additional input values and adding some
conditionals. once you have the framework, this is easy to do.

------------------------------------------
7. break down the problem into subproblems
------------------------------------------

in addition to simplifying problems, you can also just ignore
parts of the problem when you’re initially coming up with a
solution. this is my favorite technique when people do it right.

when you are asked a problem and are trying to come up with a
solution, ask yourself the following question: “is there any
function that, if i had access to it, would make it significantly
easier to solve this problem?”

oftentimes, you will find that there is an obvious function that
dramatically simplifies the problem. consider the example of
printing a linked list in reverse order. there should be two
obvious functions that would simplify this problem:
reverselinkedlist() and printlinkedlist(). if we already had
these functions, our solution becomes trivial.

void printreversedlinkedlist(node linkedlist) {

linkedlist = reverselinkedlist(linkedlist);

printlinkedlist(linkedlist);

// optionally, we can reverse our linked list again to return
it to the original state

}

our code really can’t get much simpler than that. and now that we
have our top-level function laid out, we can focus on
implementing each of these functions individually. this won’t
necessarily be trivial – reversing a linked list is a bit tricky
– but it will be a hell of a lot easier than what we were doing
before.

the key with this technique is that by breaking down the problem
into smaller components, it is much easier to see how to solve
the problem. you can start by just assuming that you have a
function that does x. now you only have to worry about doing all
of the other things. this abstraction makes it much easier to
reason about the problem.

and this technique also has an ancillary benefit. if you don’t
finish writing all of the code, it is still clear that you know
what you’re doing. if you choose to use a helper function, you
should implement that last. by implementing the core code first,
it is clear you know what’s up, and if you run out of time to
implement the helper function, chances are that was something
that would be pretty easy to do anyway. this is a great way to
compensate for lack of time/speed in an interview.

-------------------
8. take a step back
-------------------

going down a rabbit hole is one of the easiest ways to get stuck
in a coding interview. however, it’s not always obvious in the
moment that you’ve even gone down a rabbit hole in the first
place. that’s why i recommend that whenever you find yourself
starting to get stuck in a coding interview, you take a moment to
step back and look at the big picture.

let’s say that we realize that we need a function that stores
value mappings. for example we have something like int -&gt; string.
our initial solution might be to create a hashmap to store these
values. that would seem to be the logical thing.

however, we later discover that all of the integer keys are each
of the values from 0-n and we are going to want to be able to
iterate over the keys in order. now our hashmap doesn’t seem so
great, right?

however, i can’t tell you how many people i see who will just
take what they already have and try and force it to work. they’re
trying to put a square peg in a round hole. you can do it, but
it’s a lot of work.

first they have to get a list of all of the keys in the hashmap,
then they have to sort it, and then they have to iterate over it.
and that’s not to mention the extra work of putting everything
into a hashmap in the first place.

if they just used an array, it would be so much easier.

however, this is not always obvious. we tend to think about
problems in an iterative way, building up to a solution. that
means that if we don’t stop to think carefully about what we’re
doing, we may end up doing a lot of unnecessary work.

taking a step back is simply taking a moment to think about what
we’re doing at a high level and confirming that it is, in fact,
the best way that we could be accomplishing that task. you may be
surprised how often you don’t realize that there is a vastly more
efficient approach.

------------------------------------
9. collaborate with your interviewer
------------------------------------

many people see interviewing as a battle. it’s you versus the
interviewer. you’re trying to get the job and they’re trying to
take it away from you. you want to succeed and they want you to
fail.

this is one of the most destructive things that you can think in
your interview. this is completely false and it can change the
tone of the interview to be combative, which isn’t fun for
anyone.

the truth is that your interviewer wants you to succeed. their
goal is simply to make sure that you meet the standards that the
company has. if they’re being hard on you it’s because they’re
trying to make absolutely sure.

when you’re stuck on a problem, you can get feedback from your
interviewer. the more you talk out loud in your interview, the
more they will already know what’s going on, too, so the more
they will be able to help you.

one of my favorite phrases to use in an interview is simply,
“does that sound good to you?” when i come up with a solution and
i’m not sure if it’s the best, i’ll ask that question, which
gives my interviewer two options.

* if i’ve found a decent solution, they can say yes and suggest
that i start coding it up. this way i don’t waste any unnecessary
time trying to come up with an even better solution.
* if they’re not happy with my solution, they can say no and
suggest that i think about it a little more. this is helpful too
because, without really giving a hint at all, they are saying
that i’m not quite there yet.

granted, not all interviewers are going to be quite so helpful,
but there is no harm in asking and it can make your life a lot
easier.

----------------
10. ask for help
----------------

i’ve included this last because it’s definitely a last resort.
most interviewers will mark you down for needing a hint in your
interview. however, if you’re stuck and not making progress, this
is better than just twiddling your thumbs. and it doesn’t
necessarily disqualify you from getting an offer.

when you’re really stuck and not able to proceed, you can just be
upfront with your interviewer. tell them that you’re a little
stuck and ask if they can give you a hint. chances are, they’ll
offer you up something that will help you keep moving in the
right direction.

the worst thing that you can do in your interview is to give up
rather than asking for help. in the real world, there are plenty
of opportunities to get help from others, but no company wants to
have a quitter on their team. if you just give up when faced with
a hard problem, that’s definitely not what they want.

you’re not going to use all of these strategies in every
interview. they’re simply not necessary.

sometimes you’ll see a really easy problem and you won’t need to
use any of them. sometimes you’ll get a really hard problem and
have to combine several strategies.

regardless of the specific interview question, though, knowing
these strategies will make you bulletproof against even the
toughest questions.

so i want you to do something right now. pick one of these
strategies and try it out for yourself right now. we went over a
ton of stuff today so start with just picking one. i guarantee
you’ll see a big difference.

best,

sam

every day, i talk to people about careers in software
engineering. whether via email with a new subscriber to this list
or someone who has been around for the last year and a half, or
in person with one of my coaching clients, i see all different
shades of software engineers.

however, every single software engineer that i talk to aspires to
the same thing: a job at a great company.

i love this. there are so many places on the internet that
attract software engineers that just want a job to get by.

here’s a reddit post from a year ago:

(if you don't see images below, click ""display images"")

( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/7qh7h8h8qdzzk/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuynl0zs1ies1iexrllmnvbs9jaw0tzhluyw1pyy1wcm9ncmftbwluzy8= )

i find posts like this fascinating because of how they tend to
polarize people. on forums like reddit, there are posts like
this, from someone who obviously gets the value of having a
meaningful job, and then there are lots comments of jealousy from
people wishing that they could have a job like that where they
don’t have to do any work.

i love the readers of byte by byte because you don’t think that
way. you know what you really want, whether it’s a big 4 or a hot
startup. my job is just to show you how to get there.

however, here’s the problem. just knowing what you want is not
enough. there are tons of people out there gunning for the same
jobs. while the number is probably a little skewed down, google
has an acceptance rate of ~1%. that means out of 100
interviewees, you need to be the best.

when you’re interviewing at companies like google, just having a
vague understanding of a topic isn’t going to cut it. you need to
understand every topic backwards and forwards.

this is why i created coding interview mastery: dynamic
programming ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/75u7h8hp6o56g/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ). after seeing so many
of my students putting in tons of effort only to still fail, i
wanted to ensure that there was a better way to learn dynamic
programming.

with topics that counterintuitive, you might put in tens of hours
only to realize you’ve barely made a dent in it and you can still
only solve the most basic of problems. cim: dynamic programming (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/o2ikhqhl6rd6z/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ) takes everything that you need to
know for your interview and packages in such a way that you can
not only quickly understand it, but easily remember it in the
heat of the interview.

if you’re serious about interviewing, you’re going to put in many
hours into studying and preparing. however, even with all the
hours you’re putting in, there are so many different topics that
it’s not like you’re actually spending a whole lot of time on any
one.

when you spend weeks on dynamic programming, that’s time that
you’re taking away from other topics that you need to study.
remember that you need to be very strong on every topic to get
the job at google.

ultimately, as i talked about last week, this is an opportunity
to invest in yourself. while no one is forcing you to do so,
recognize how not making this investment will affect your life.
you will continue studying dynamic programming. maybe you’ll
figure it out. maybe you won’t. maybe you’ll get the job. maybe
you won’t.

but regardless of the outcome, you will invest large amounts of
your time. time that no amount of money can bring back. chances
are, you’ll realize later that you actually needed this course,
and you’ll have wasted time and then still spend the money to
purchase the course.

this is why you should invest in this course today (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/zefghnhrk3xkg/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ). not tomorrow, not next week. the
longer you put it off, the more time you waste.

if you’re ready to get the job you’ve dreamed of and nail dynamic
programming once and for all, join the course here. (

In fact, I&#39;ve found through working with","[<p>hi sunny khandare -

yesterday i told you about the #1 thing that people screw up in
their interviews: they don’t know what to do if they get stuck.

in fact, i’ve found through working with dozens of students that
many people don’t even know how to approach a new problem.
rather, they simply go into the interview and hope that a
solution magically appears to them.

this is not a good strategy.

if your interviewer knows what they’re doing, they will
specifically ask you a question where the solution is nonobvious.
that doesn’t mean you have to be a genius to be able to solve it,
but you do have to have a structured approach.

when you see a problem that you don’t recognize, what is your
plan? here are 10 strategies to keep in your back pocket in case
you get stuck during your interview.

------------------------------
1. find a brute force solution
------------------------------

there’s probably one reason above all others that causes
candidates to get stuck finding a solution: they try to
immediately find an optimal solution.

i’ve discussed starting with brute force solutions (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/reh8hoh5qdn7x/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuynl0zs1ies1iexrllmnvbs9icnv0zs1mb3jjzq== ) in the past, but it bears
repeating. it is very easy to go down different rabbit holes when
trying to find an optimal solution and finding a brute force
solution always gives you a grounded place to come back to. even
though it may not be a great solution, if you can’t find a better
solution, it gives you something to fall back on.

the brute force solution also gives you a jumping-off point to
optimize your code. with a brute force solution, it is often easy
to see places in which you are doing repeated work or otherwise
slowing down the execution.

after finding the brute force solution, you can use gayle
laackmann mcdowell’s bud optimization (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/8kuqhoh5gdk3k/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuc2xpzgvzagfyzs5uzxqvz2f5bguyl2nyywnraw5nlxrozs1pbnrlcnzpzxctc2tpbgxzlwnvzgluzy1zb2z0lxnrawxscy1wcm9kdwn0lw1hbmfnzw1lbnqtagfuzg91dhm= ), which stands for bottlenecks,
unnecessary work, and duplicated work. by identifying places in
your code that are slowing everything else down, you can find
ways in which to optimize the code.

for example, if you’re looping through an array and for each
element, you need to look up that element in another array, you
have an o(n * m) time complexity, if n and m are the lengths of
the two arrays. however, if you put the second array into a set,
you get a lookup time of o(1), so your time complexity improves
to o(n).

finding a brute force solution is incredibly valuable, because it
helps you understand the problem better and ensures that you have
a solution.

-------------------------------
2. fully understand the problem
-------------------------------

it is shocking to me how many people will start trying to solve
an interview problem without really understanding what they’re
supposed to do.

in fact, when evaluating new coaching clients, i always ask them
to simply print a linked list in reverse order. this should be a
very simple task, but many people miss the core directive, which
is to print the list. i often find people trying to return a
reversed list or other such things. however, that is not what i
am asking and can be significantly more difficult.

when problems are more complicated or confusing, i often find
that people will spend a few minutes trying to understand the
problem, but eventually give up and figure they’ll just start
solving it. that’s a critical mistake, though. how can you solve
a problem when you don’t know what you’re solving?

there are a couple things that you can do if you’re struggling to
understand a coding interview question. the first is to simply
ask more questions of your interviewer. ask them to show you an
example or clarify any specific points on which you’re unclear.
don’t feel bad about asking a lot of questions. it’s their job to
make you understand what to do.

you can also work through a few examples. look at what the inputs
and outputs are. what is the function signature going to be?
explicitly defining these parameters can be very helpful in
thinking about the problem. for example, if you’re writing a
recursive function, it’s way easier to figure out the base case
when you know what the return type should be.

-----------------------------------
3. work through the problem by hand
-----------------------------------

not sure how to solve the problem in a coding interview? well can
you solve the problem yourself without writing any code? if you
understand the problem thoroughly, you should be able to answer
it. and if you can solve it by hand, you can solve it with code.

let’s consider the example of determining whether a string is a
palindrome. say i give you the string “acaramanamaraca”. is it a
palindrome? go ahead and decide.

how did you solve it? did you compare the first and last letters,
then the second and the second-to-last and so on? did you reverse
the string and then compare them? there are several different
ways that you can determine if a string is a palindrome by hand.

and now that you’ve done it by hand, can you write code to do the
same thing? in the two example solutions that i described, i
basically explained an algorithm that you can use to solve this
problem by hand. and that means it’s easy to write code to solve
it.

the key with this technique is just to be as detailed and
specific as possible when solving it by hand. if you say “oh i
just know it’s a palindrome”, then that’s not very helpful. how
do you know? if you’re struggling to think about it, pick a
larger input to solve by hand. something that you can’t do in
your head.

for example, if i asked you to multiply two numbers, it would be
silly to use the example of 3*4, since presumably you have that
memorized from doing multiplication tables in elementary school.
a far better example would be 14235 * 2512. with this, it is very
unlikely that you’ll be able to do it in your head so you have to
write it out. this will help you identify the “algorithm” that
you’re using.

------------------------------------------------------
4. brainstorm different data structures and algorithms
------------------------------------------------------

sometimes the easiest way to approach a coding interview question
is to take different common solutions and see if any of them
apply. we can do exactly this in coding interviews by
brainstorming different data structures and algorithms and seeing
if any of them are a good fit for our problem.

let’s say that we have a problem that involves strings. for
example, maybe we want to all the strings in an array that have a
certain prefix. let’s brainstorm:

* just keep the strings in the array. we iterate through the
array and just check the prefix of each string.
* add all the strings to a hashmap with mappings for each
possible prefix. that might work but there are a lot of
possibilities.
* we could sort the array of strings. that might make things
easier.
* maybe we could do some sort of tree structure?
* speaking of trees, what if we used a trie?

from this basic brainstorm, we’ve come up with multiple valid
possibilities. in this case, the problem that we’re looking at
does have many possible solutions, so that’s to be expected. even
if we only had one way to solve the problem, though, this may
help elucidate ways in which we can approach it.

the key is that no idea is too dumb when you’re brainstorming.
you’re doing this in front of your interviewer, so the temptation
is to try and sound smart, but you can very easily shoot yourself
in the foot by doing this. if you filter yourself while
brainstorming, you may miss key insights.

put everything down on the whiteboard and then see if anything
jumps out at you. can you make any clear connections? this
technique is great for sparking ideas.

--------------------------------------------
5. consider all the information you’re given
--------------------------------------------

lots of times, our interviewers give us clues as to how we should
think about a problem. by giving us details about how the input
is formatted or any restrictions on the input, they are subtly
hinting at how to view the problem.

for example, let’s say that we wanted to find a value in a sorted
matrix. if we know that the rows and columns of the matrix are in
sorted order, that gives us a big clue for how we can solve the
problem.

without that information, we’re fairly limited in how we can
approach this problem. our best bet would be to just iterate over
every value in the matrix to see if the value we’re searching for
exists. however, we have a big clue, which is that our matrix is
sorted.

knowing the matrix is sorted, we have algorithms to help us deal
with that. there’s binary search and we can also consider other
properties of our matrix. for example, since both rows and
columns are sorted, if we pick an arbitrary cell [i, j], any cell
and is going to have a value less than cell [i, j].

from the information given, if you’re stuck, you can simply take
some time to extrapolate everything you can. if the array is
sorted, what does that mean? if the input is in tree format, how
can we use that to our advantage? look for these clues.

-----------------------
6. simplify the problem
-----------------------

my favorite types of problems to ask as an interviewer are
problems that have a lot of moving pieces. these force the
interviewee to consider not only each part of the problem, but
how all of the different components interact with each other.

as an interviewer, this is great because i get a better idea of
an interviewee’s mental model. as an interviewee, however, it can
be difficult. whenever you see a problem that has a lot of
different stuff going on, a good starting point is to consider a
simpler problem.

let’s say that we want to find the path through a matrix with the
greatest product. this is a moderately difficult problem, but it
is complicated even more if you consider that values in your
matrix can be negative. since multiplying negatives cancel each
other out, this problem gets pretty tricky pretty fast.

but here’s the thing. the solution is not fundamentally different
than solving the problem for only positive numbers. if you get
the solution for solely positive values, then it is relatively
easy to extend the solution to include negative numbers as well.

similar to first working through a brute force solution, solving
a simpler version of the problem gives you a really good starting
point from which to build out your solution. it is often simply a
matter of handling additional input values and adding some
conditionals. once you have the framework, this is easy to do.

------------------------------------------
7. break down the problem into subproblems
------------------------------------------

in addition to simplifying problems, you can also just ignore
parts of the problem when you’re initially coming up with a
solution. this is my favorite technique when people do it right.

when you are asked a problem and are trying to come up with a
solution, ask yourself the following question: “is there any
function that, if i had access to it, would make it significantly
easier to solve this problem?”

oftentimes, you will find that there is an obvious function that
dramatically simplifies the problem. consider the example of
printing a linked list in reverse order. there should be two
obvious functions that would simplify this problem:
reverselinkedlist() and printlinkedlist(). if we already had
these functions, our solution becomes trivial.

void printreversedlinkedlist(node linkedlist) {

linkedlist = reverselinkedlist(linkedlist);

printlinkedlist(linkedlist);

// optionally, we can reverse our linked list again to return
it to the original state

}

our code really can’t get much simpler than that. and now that we
have our top-level function laid out, we can focus on
implementing each of these functions individually. this won’t
necessarily be trivial – reversing a linked list is a bit tricky
– but it will be a hell of a lot easier than what we were doing
before.

the key with this technique is that by breaking down the problem
into smaller components, it is much easier to see how to solve
the problem. you can start by just assuming that you have a
function that does x. now you only have to worry about doing all
of the other things. this abstraction makes it much easier to
reason about the problem.

and this technique also has an ancillary benefit. if you don’t
finish writing all of the code, it is still clear that you know
what you’re doing. if you choose to use a helper function, you
should implement that last. by implementing the core code first,
it is clear you know what’s up, and if you run out of time to
implement the helper function, chances are that was something
that would be pretty easy to do anyway. this is a great way to
compensate for lack of time/speed in an interview.

-------------------
8. take a step back
-------------------

going down a rabbit hole is one of the easiest ways to get stuck
in a coding interview. however, it’s not always obvious in the
moment that you’ve even gone down a rabbit hole in the first
place. that’s why i recommend that whenever you find yourself
starting to get stuck in a coding interview, you take a moment to
step back and look at the big picture.

let’s say that we realize that we need a function that stores
value mappings. for example we have something like int -&gt; string.
our initial solution might be to create a hashmap to store these
values. that would seem to be the logical thing.

however, we later discover that all of the integer keys are each
of the values from 0-n and we are going to want to be able to
iterate over the keys in order. now our hashmap doesn’t seem so
great, right?

however, i can’t tell you how many people i see who will just
take what they already have and try and force it to work. they’re
trying to put a square peg in a round hole. you can do it, but
it’s a lot of work.

first they have to get a list of all of the keys in the hashmap,
then they have to sort it, and then they have to iterate over it.
and that’s not to mention the extra work of putting everything
into a hashmap in the first place.

if they just used an array, it would be so much easier.

however, this is not always obvious. we tend to think about
problems in an iterative way, building up to a solution. that
means that if we don’t stop to think carefully about what we’re
doing, we may end up doing a lot of unnecessary work.

taking a step back is simply taking a moment to think about what
we’re doing at a high level and confirming that it is, in fact,
the best way that we could be accomplishing that task. you may be
surprised how often you don’t realize that there is a vastly more
efficient approach.

------------------------------------
9. collaborate with your interviewer
------------------------------------

many people see interviewing as a battle. it’s you versus the
interviewer. you’re trying to get the job and they’re trying to
take it away from you. you want to succeed and they want you to
fail.

this is one of the most destructive things that you can think in
your interview. this is completely false and it can change the
tone of the interview to be combative, which isn’t fun for
anyone.

the truth is that your interviewer wants you to succeed. their
goal is simply to make sure that you meet the standards that the
company has. if they’re being hard on you it’s because they’re
trying to make absolutely sure.

when you’re stuck on a problem, you can get feedback from your
interviewer. the more you talk out loud in your interview, the
more they will already know what’s going on, too, so the more
they will be able to help you.

one of my favorite phrases to use in an interview is simply,
“does that sound good to you?” when i come up with a solution and
i’m not sure if it’s the best, i’ll ask that question, which
gives my interviewer two options.

* if i’ve found a decent solution, they can say yes and suggest
that i start coding it up. this way i don’t waste any unnecessary
time trying to come up with an even better solution.
* if they’re not happy with my solution, they can say no and
suggest that i think about it a little more. this is helpful too
because, without really giving a hint at all, they are saying
that i’m not quite there yet.

granted, not all interviewers are going to be quite so helpful,
but there is no harm in asking and it can make your life a lot
easier.

----------------
10. ask for help
----------------

i’ve included this last because it’s definitely a last resort.
most interviewers will mark you down for needing a hint in your
interview. however, if you’re stuck and not making progress, this
is better than just twiddling your thumbs. and it doesn’t
necessarily disqualify you from getting an offer.

when you’re really stuck and not able to proceed, you can just be
upfront with your interviewer. tell them that you’re a little
stuck and ask if they can give you a hint. chances are, they’ll
offer you up something that will help you keep moving in the
right direction.

the worst thing that you can do in your interview is to give up
rather than asking for help. in the real world, there are plenty
of opportunities to get help from others, but no company wants to
have a quitter on their team. if you just give up when faced with
a hard problem, that’s definitely not what they want.

you’re not going to use all of these strategies in every
interview. they’re simply not necessary.

sometimes you’ll see a really easy problem and you won’t need to
use any of them. sometimes you’ll get a really hard problem and
have to combine several strategies.

regardless of the specific interview question, though, knowing
these strategies will make you bulletproof against even the
toughest questions.

so i want you to do something right now. pick one of these
strategies and try it out for yourself right now. we went over a
ton of stuff today so start with just picking one. i guarantee
you’ll see a big difference.

best,

sam

every day, i talk to people about careers in software
engineering. whether via email with a new subscriber to this list
or someone who has been around for the last year and a half, or
in person with one of my coaching clients, i see all different
shades of software engineers.

however, every single software engineer that i talk to aspires to
the same thing: a job at a great company.

i love this. there are so many places on the internet that
attract software engineers that just want a job to get by.

here’s a reddit post from a year ago:

(if you don't see images below, click ""display images"")

( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/7qh7h8h8qdzzk/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuynl0zs1ies1iexrllmnvbs9jaw0tzhluyw1pyy1wcm9ncmftbwluzy8= )

i find posts like this fascinating because of how they tend to
polarize people. on forums like reddit, there are posts like
this, from someone who obviously gets the value of having a
meaningful job, and then there are lots comments of jealousy from
people wishing that they could have a job like that where they
don’t have to do any work.

i love the readers of byte by byte because you don’t think that
way. you know what you really want, whether it’s a big 4 or a hot
startup. my job is just to show you how to get there.

however, here’s the problem. just knowing what you want is not
enough. there are tons of people out there gunning for the same
jobs. while the number is probably a little skewed down, google
has an acceptance rate of ~1%. that means out of 100
interviewees, you need to be the best.

when you’re interviewing at companies like google, just having a
vague understanding of a topic isn’t going to cut it. you need to
understand every topic backwards and forwards.

this is why i created coding interview mastery: dynamic
programming ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/75u7h8hp6o56g/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ). after seeing so many
of my students putting in tons of effort only to still fail, i
wanted to ensure that there was a better way to learn dynamic
programming.

with topics that counterintuitive, you might put in tens of hours
only to realize you’ve barely made a dent in it and you can still
only solve the most basic of problems. cim: dynamic programming (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/o2ikhqhl6rd6z/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ) takes everything that you need to
know for your interview and packages in such a way that you can
not only quickly understand it, but easily remember it in the
heat of the interview.

if you’re serious about interviewing, you’re going to put in many
hours into studying and preparing. however, even with all the
hours you’re putting in, there are so many different topics that
it’s not like you’re actually spending a whole lot of time on any
one.

when you spend weeks on dynamic programming, that’s time that
you’re taking away from other topics that you need to study.
remember that you need to be very strong on every topic to get
the job at google.

ultimately, as i talked about last week, this is an opportunity
to invest in yourself. while no one is forcing you to do so,
recognize how not making this investment will affect your life.
you will continue studying dynamic programming. maybe you’ll
figure it out. maybe you won’t. maybe you’ll get the job. maybe
you won’t.

but regardless of the outcome, you will invest large amounts of
your time. time that no amount of money can bring back. chances
are, you’ll realize later that you actually needed this course,
and you’ll have wasted time and then still spend the money to
purchase the course.

this is why you should invest in this course today (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/zefghnhrk3xkg/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ). not tomorrow, not next week. the
longer you put it off, the more time you waste.

if you’re ready to get the job you’ve dreamed of and nail dynamic
programming once and for all, join the course here. (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/pxteh9h52zo2v/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz )

In fact, I&#39;ve found through working with","[<p>hi sunny khandare -

yesterday i told you about the #1 thing that people screw up in
their interviews: they don’t know what to do if they get stuck.

in fact, i’ve found through working with dozens of students that
many people don’t even know how to approach a new problem.
rather, they simply go into the interview and hope that a
solution magically appears to them.

this is not a good strategy.

if your interviewer knows what they’re doing, they will
specifically ask you a question where the solution is nonobvious.
that doesn’t mean you have to be a genius to be able to solve it,
but you do have to have a structured approach.

when you see a problem that you don’t recognize, what is your
plan? here are 10 strategies to keep in your back pocket in case
you get stuck during your interview.

------------------------------
1. find a brute force solution
------------------------------

there’s probably one reason above all others that causes
candidates to get stuck finding a solution: they try to
immediately find an optimal solution.

i’ve discussed starting with brute force solutions (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/reh8hoh5qdn7x/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuynl0zs1ies1iexrllmnvbs9icnv0zs1mb3jjzq== ) in the past, but it bears
repeating. it is very easy to go down different rabbit holes when
trying to find an optimal solution and finding a brute force
solution always gives you a grounded place to come back to. even
though it may not be a great solution, if you can’t find a better
solution, it gives you something to fall back on.

the brute force solution also gives you a jumping-off point to
optimize your code. with a brute force solution, it is often easy
to see places in which you are doing repeated work or otherwise
slowing down the execution.

after finding the brute force solution, you can use gayle
laackmann mcdowell’s bud optimization (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/8kuqhoh5gdk3k/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuc2xpzgvzagfyzs5uzxqvz2f5bguyl2nyywnraw5nlxrozs1pbnrlcnzpzxctc2tpbgxzlwnvzgluzy1zb2z0lxnrawxscy1wcm9kdwn0lw1hbmfnzw1lbnqtagfuzg91dhm= ), which stands for bottlenecks,
unnecessary work, and duplicated work. by identifying places in
your code that are slowing everything else down, you can find
ways in which to optimize the code.

for example, if you’re looping through an array and for each
element, you need to look up that element in another array, you
have an o(n * m) time complexity, if n and m are the lengths of
the two arrays. however, if you put the second array into a set,
you get a lookup time of o(1), so your time complexity improves
to o(n).

finding a brute force solution is incredibly valuable, because it
helps you understand the problem better and ensures that you have
a solution.

-------------------------------
2. fully understand the problem
-------------------------------

it is shocking to me how many people will start trying to solve
an interview problem without really understanding what they’re
supposed to do.

in fact, when evaluating new coaching clients, i always ask them
to simply print a linked list in reverse order. this should be a
very simple task, but many people miss the core directive, which
is to print the list. i often find people trying to return a
reversed list or other such things. however, that is not what i
am asking and can be significantly more difficult.

when problems are more complicated or confusing, i often find
that people will spend a few minutes trying to understand the
problem, but eventually give up and figure they’ll just start
solving it. that’s a critical mistake, though. how can you solve
a problem when you don’t know what you’re solving?

there are a couple things that you can do if you’re struggling to
understand a coding interview question. the first is to simply
ask more questions of your interviewer. ask them to show you an
example or clarify any specific points on which you’re unclear.
don’t feel bad about asking a lot of questions. it’s their job to
make you understand what to do.

you can also work through a few examples. look at what the inputs
and outputs are. what is the function signature going to be?
explicitly defining these parameters can be very helpful in
thinking about the problem. for example, if you’re writing a
recursive function, it’s way easier to figure out the base case
when you know what the return type should be.

-----------------------------------
3. work through the problem by hand
-----------------------------------

not sure how to solve the problem in a coding interview? well can
you solve the problem yourself without writing any code? if you
understand the problem thoroughly, you should be able to answer
it. and if you can solve it by hand, you can solve it with code.

let’s consider the example of determining whether a string is a
palindrome. say i give you the string “acaramanamaraca”. is it a
palindrome? go ahead and decide.

how did you solve it? did you compare the first and last letters,
then the second and the second-to-last and so on? did you reverse
the string and then compare them? there are several different
ways that you can determine if a string is a palindrome by hand.

and now that you’ve done it by hand, can you write code to do the
same thing? in the two example solutions that i described, i
basically explained an algorithm that you can use to solve this
problem by hand. and that means it’s easy to write code to solve
it.

the key with this technique is just to be as detailed and
specific as possible when solving it by hand. if you say “oh i
just know it’s a palindrome”, then that’s not very helpful. how
do you know? if you’re struggling to think about it, pick a
larger input to solve by hand. something that you can’t do in
your head.

for example, if i asked you to multiply two numbers, it would be
silly to use the example of 3*4, since presumably you have that
memorized from doing multiplication tables in elementary school.
a far better example would be 14235 * 2512. with this, it is very
unlikely that you’ll be able to do it in your head so you have to
write it out. this will help you identify the “algorithm” that
you’re using.

------------------------------------------------------
4. brainstorm different data structures and algorithms
------------------------------------------------------

sometimes the easiest way to approach a coding interview question
is to take different common solutions and see if any of them
apply. we can do exactly this in coding interviews by
brainstorming different data structures and algorithms and seeing
if any of them are a good fit for our problem.

let’s say that we have a problem that involves strings. for
example, maybe we want to all the strings in an array that have a
certain prefix. let’s brainstorm:

* just keep the strings in the array. we iterate through the
array and just check the prefix of each string.
* add all the strings to a hashmap with mappings for each
possible prefix. that might work but there are a lot of
possibilities.
* we could sort the array of strings. that might make things
easier.
* maybe we could do some sort of tree structure?
* speaking of trees, what if we used a trie?

from this basic brainstorm, we’ve come up with multiple valid
possibilities. in this case, the problem that we’re looking at
does have many possible solutions, so that’s to be expected. even
if we only had one way to solve the problem, though, this may
help elucidate ways in which we can approach it.

the key is that no idea is too dumb when you’re brainstorming.
you’re doing this in front of your interviewer, so the temptation
is to try and sound smart, but you can very easily shoot yourself
in the foot by doing this. if you filter yourself while
brainstorming, you may miss key insights.

put everything down on the whiteboard and then see if anything
jumps out at you. can you make any clear connections? this
technique is great for sparking ideas.

--------------------------------------------
5. consider all the information you’re given
--------------------------------------------

lots of times, our interviewers give us clues as to how we should
think about a problem. by giving us details about how the input
is formatted or any restrictions on the input, they are subtly
hinting at how to view the problem.

for example, let’s say that we wanted to find a value in a sorted
matrix. if we know that the rows and columns of the matrix are in
sorted order, that gives us a big clue for how we can solve the
problem.

without that information, we’re fairly limited in how we can
approach this problem. our best bet would be to just iterate over
every value in the matrix to see if the value we’re searching for
exists. however, we have a big clue, which is that our matrix is
sorted.

knowing the matrix is sorted, we have algorithms to help us deal
with that. there’s binary search and we can also consider other
properties of our matrix. for example, since both rows and
columns are sorted, if we pick an arbitrary cell [i, j], any cell
and is going to have a value less than cell [i, j].

from the information given, if you’re stuck, you can simply take
some time to extrapolate everything you can. if the array is
sorted, what does that mean? if the input is in tree format, how
can we use that to our advantage? look for these clues.

-----------------------
6. simplify the problem
-----------------------

my favorite types of problems to ask as an interviewer are
problems that have a lot of moving pieces. these force the
interviewee to consider not only each part of the problem, but
how all of the different components interact with each other.

as an interviewer, this is great because i get a better idea of
an interviewee’s mental model. as an interviewee, however, it can
be difficult. whenever you see a problem that has a lot of
different stuff going on, a good starting point is to consider a
simpler problem.

let’s say that we want to find the path through a matrix with the
greatest product. this is a moderately difficult problem, but it
is complicated even more if you consider that values in your
matrix can be negative. since multiplying negatives cancel each
other out, this problem gets pretty tricky pretty fast.

but here’s the thing. the solution is not fundamentally different
than solving the problem for only positive numbers. if you get
the solution for solely positive values, then it is relatively
easy to extend the solution to include negative numbers as well.

similar to first working through a brute force solution, solving
a simpler version of the problem gives you a really good starting
point from which to build out your solution. it is often simply a
matter of handling additional input values and adding some
conditionals. once you have the framework, this is easy to do.

------------------------------------------
7. break down the problem into subproblems
------------------------------------------

in addition to simplifying problems, you can also just ignore
parts of the problem when you’re initially coming up with a
solution. this is my favorite technique when people do it right.

when you are asked a problem and are trying to come up with a
solution, ask yourself the following question: “is there any
function that, if i had access to it, would make it significantly
easier to solve this problem?”

oftentimes, you will find that there is an obvious function that
dramatically simplifies the problem. consider the example of
printing a linked list in reverse order. there should be two
obvious functions that would simplify this problem:
reverselinkedlist() and printlinkedlist(). if we already had
these functions, our solution becomes trivial.

void printreversedlinkedlist(node linkedlist) {

linkedlist = reverselinkedlist(linkedlist);

printlinkedlist(linkedlist);

// optionally, we can reverse our linked list again to return
it to the original state

}

our code really can’t get much simpler than that. and now that we
have our top-level function laid out, we can focus on
implementing each of these functions individually. this won’t
necessarily be trivial – reversing a linked list is a bit tricky
– but it will be a hell of a lot easier than what we were doing
before.

the key with this technique is that by breaking down the problem
into smaller components, it is much easier to see how to solve
the problem. you can start by just assuming that you have a
function that does x. now you only have to worry about doing all
of the other things. this abstraction makes it much easier to
reason about the problem.

and this technique also has an ancillary benefit. if you don’t
finish writing all of the code, it is still clear that you know
what you’re doing. if you choose to use a helper function, you
should implement that last. by implementing the core code first,
it is clear you know what’s up, and if you run out of time to
implement the helper function, chances are that was something
that would be pretty easy to do anyway. this is a great way to
compensate for lack of time/speed in an interview.

-------------------
8. take a step back
-------------------

going down a rabbit hole is one of the easiest ways to get stuck
in a coding interview. however, it’s not always obvious in the
moment that you’ve even gone down a rabbit hole in the first
place. that’s why i recommend that whenever you find yourself
starting to get stuck in a coding interview, you take a moment to
step back and look at the big picture.

let’s say that we realize that we need a function that stores
value mappings. for example we have something like int -&gt; string.
our initial solution might be to create a hashmap to store these
values. that would seem to be the logical thing.

however, we later discover that all of the integer keys are each
of the values from 0-n and we are going to want to be able to
iterate over the keys in order. now our hashmap doesn’t seem so
great, right?

however, i can’t tell you how many people i see who will just
take what they already have and try and force it to work. they’re
trying to put a square peg in a round hole. you can do it, but
it’s a lot of work.

first they have to get a list of all of the keys in the hashmap,
then they have to sort it, and then they have to iterate over it.
and that’s not to mention the extra work of putting everything
into a hashmap in the first place.

if they just used an array, it would be so much easier.

however, this is not always obvious. we tend to think about
problems in an iterative way, building up to a solution. that
means that if we don’t stop to think carefully about what we’re
doing, we may end up doing a lot of unnecessary work.

taking a step back is simply taking a moment to think about what
we’re doing at a high level and confirming that it is, in fact,
the best way that we could be accomplishing that task. you may be
surprised how often you don’t realize that there is a vastly more
efficient approach.

------------------------------------
9. collaborate with your interviewer
------------------------------------

many people see interviewing as a battle. it’s you versus the
interviewer. you’re trying to get the job and they’re trying to
take it away from you. you want to succeed and they want you to
fail.

this is one of the most destructive things that you can think in
your interview. this is completely false and it can change the
tone of the interview to be combative, which isn’t fun for
anyone.

the truth is that your interviewer wants you to succeed. their
goal is simply to make sure that you meet the standards that the
company has. if they’re being hard on you it’s because they’re
trying to make absolutely sure.

when you’re stuck on a problem, you can get feedback from your
interviewer. the more you talk out loud in your interview, the
more they will already know what’s going on, too, so the more
they will be able to help you.

one of my favorite phrases to use in an interview is simply,
“does that sound good to you?” when i come up with a solution and
i’m not sure if it’s the best, i’ll ask that question, which
gives my interviewer two options.

* if i’ve found a decent solution, they can say yes and suggest
that i start coding it up. this way i don’t waste any unnecessary
time trying to come up with an even better solution.
* if they’re not happy with my solution, they can say no and
suggest that i think about it a little more. this is helpful too
because, without really giving a hint at all, they are saying
that i’m not quite there yet.

granted, not all interviewers are going to be quite so helpful,
but there is no harm in asking and it can make your life a lot
easier.

----------------
10. ask for help
----------------

i’ve included this last because it’s definitely a last resort.
most interviewers will mark you down for needing a hint in your
interview. however, if you’re stuck and not making progress, this
is better than just twiddling your thumbs. and it doesn’t
necessarily disqualify you from getting an offer.

when you’re really stuck and not able to proceed, you can just be
upfront with your interviewer. tell them that you’re a little
stuck and ask if they can give you a hint. chances are, they’ll
offer you up something that will help you keep moving in the
right direction.

the worst thing that you can do in your interview is to give up
rather than asking for help. in the real world, there are plenty
of opportunities to get help from others, but no company wants to
have a quitter on their team. if you just give up when faced with
a hard problem, that’s definitely not what they want.

you’re not going to use all of these strategies in every
interview. they’re simply not necessary.

sometimes you’ll see a really easy problem and you won’t need to
use any of them. sometimes you’ll get a really hard problem and
have to combine several strategies.

regardless of the specific interview question, though, knowing
these strategies will make you bulletproof against even the
toughest questions.

so i want you to do something right now. pick one of these
strategies and try it out for yourself right now. we went over a
ton of stuff today so start with just picking one. i guarantee
you’ll see a big difference.

best,

sam

( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/7qh7h8h8qdzzk/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuynl0zs1ies1iexrllmnvbs9jaw0tzhluyw1pyy1wcm9ncmftbwluzy8= )

i find posts like this fascinating because of how they tend to
polarize people. on forums like reddit, there are posts like
this, from someone who obviously gets the value of having a
meaningful job, and then there are lots comments of jealousy from
people wishing that they could have a job like that where they
don’t have to do any work.

i love the readers of byte by byte because you don’t think that
way. you know what you really want, whether it’s a big 4 or a hot
startup. my job is just to show you how to get there.

however, here’s the problem. just knowing what you want is not
enough. there are tons of people out there gunning for the same
jobs. while the number is probably a little skewed down, google
has an acceptance rate of ~1%. that means out of 100
interviewees, you need to be the best.

when you’re interviewing at companies like google, just having a
vague understanding of a topic isn’t going to cut it. you need to
understand every topic backwards and forwards.

this is why i created coding interview mastery: dynamic
programming ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/75u7h8hp6o56g/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ). after seeing so many
of my students putting in tons of effort only to still fail, i
wanted to ensure that there was a better way to learn dynamic
programming.

with topics that counterintuitive, you might put in tens of hours
only to realize you’ve barely made a dent in it and you can still
only solve the most basic of problems. cim: dynamic programming (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/o2ikhqhl6rd6z/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ) takes everything that you need to
know for your interview and packages in such a way that you can
not only quickly understand it, but easily remember it in the
heat of the interview.

if you’re serious about interviewing, you’re going to put in many
hours into studying and preparing. however, even with all the
hours you’re putting in, there are so many different topics that
it’s not like you’re actually spending a whole lot of time on any
one.

when you spend weeks on dynamic programming, that’s time that
you’re taking away from other topics that you need to study.
remember that you need to be very strong on every topic to get
the job at google.

ultimately, as i talked about last week, this is an opportunity
to invest in yourself. while no one is forcing you to do so,
recognize how not making this investment will affect your life.
you will continue studying dynamic programming. maybe you’ll
figure it out. maybe you won’t. maybe you’ll get the job. maybe
you won’t.

but regardless of the outcome, you will invest large amounts of
your time. time that no amount of money can bring back. chances
are, you’ll realize later that you actually needed this course,
and you’ll have wasted time and then still spend the money to
purchase the course.

this is why you should invest in this course today (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/zefghnhrk3xkg/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ). not tomorrow, not next week. the
longer you put it off, the more time you waste.

if you’re ready to get the job you’ve dreamed of and nail dynamic
programming once and for all, join the course here. (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/pxteh9h52zo2v/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz )

yesterday i told you about the #1 thing that people screw up in
their interviews: they don’t know what to do if they get stuck.

in fact, i’ve found through working with dozens of students that
many people don’t even know how to approach a new problem.
rather, they simply go into the interview and hope that a
solution magically appears to them.

this is not a good strategy.

if your interviewer knows what they’re doing, they will
specifically ask you a question where the solution is nonobvious.
that doesn’t mean you have to be a genius to be able to solve it,
but you do have to have a structured approach.

when you see a problem that you don’t recognize, what is your
plan? here are 10 strategies to keep in your back pocket in case
you get stuck during your interview.

------------------------------
1. find a brute force solution
------------------------------

there’s probably one reason above all others that causes
candidates to get stuck finding a solution: they try to
immediately find an optimal solution.

i’ve discussed starting with brute force solutions (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/reh8hoh5qdn7x/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuynl0zs1ies1iexrllmnvbs9icnv0zs1mb3jjzq== ) in the past, but it bears
repeating. it is very easy to go down different rabbit holes when
trying to find an optimal solution and finding a brute force
solution always gives you a grounded place to come back to. even
though it may not be a great solution, if you can’t find a better
solution, it gives you something to fall back on.

the brute force solution also gives you a jumping-off point to
optimize your code. with a brute force solution, it is often easy
to see places in which you are doing repeated work or otherwise
slowing down the execution.

after finding the brute force solution, you can use gayle
laackmann mcdowell’s bud optimization (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/8kuqhoh5gdk3k/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuc2xpzgvzagfyzs5uzxqvz2f5bguyl2nyywnraw5nlxrozs1pbnrlcnzpzxctc2tpbgxzlwnvzgluzy1zb2z0lxnrawxscy1wcm9kdwn0lw1hbmfnzw1lbnqtagfuzg91dhm= ), which stands for bottlenecks,
unnecessary work, and duplicated work. by identifying places in
your code that are slowing everything else down, you can find
ways in which to optimize the code.

for example, if you’re looping through an array and for each
element, you need to look up that element in another array, you
have an o(n * m) time complexity, if n and m are the lengths of
the two arrays. however, if you put the second array into a set,
you get a lookup time of o(1), so your time complexity improves
to o(n).

finding a brute force solution is incredibly valuable, because it
helps you understand the problem better and ensures that you have
a solution.

-------------------------------
2. fully understand the problem
-------------------------------

it is shocking to me how many people will start trying to solve
an interview problem without really understanding what they’re
supposed to do.

in fact, when evaluating new coaching clients, i always ask them
to simply print a linked list in reverse order. this should be a
very simple task, but many people miss the core directive, which
is to print the list. i often find people trying to return a
reversed list or other such things. however, that is not what i
am asking and can be significantly more difficult.

when problems are more complicated or confusing, i often find
that people will spend a few minutes trying to understand the
problem, but eventually give up and figure they’ll just start
solving it. that’s a critical mistake, though. how can you solve
a problem when you don’t know what you’re solving?

there are a couple things that you can do if you’re struggling to
understand a coding interview question. the first is to simply
ask more questions of your interviewer. ask them to show you an
example or clarify any specific points on which you’re unclear.
don’t feel bad about asking a lot of questions. it’s their job to
make you understand what to do.

you can also work through a few examples. look at what the inputs
and outputs are. what is the function signature going to be?
explicitly defining these parameters can be very helpful in
thinking about the problem. for example, if you’re writing a
recursive function, it’s way easier to figure out the base case
when you know what the return type should be.

-----------------------------------
3. work through the problem by hand
-----------------------------------

not sure how to solve the problem in a coding interview? well can
you solve the problem yourself without writing any code? if you
understand the problem thoroughly, you should be able to answer
it. and if you can solve it by hand, you can solve it with code.

let’s consider the example of determining whether a string is a
palindrome. say i give you the string “acaramanamaraca”. is it a
palindrome? go ahead and decide.

how did you solve it? did you compare the first and last letters,
then the second and the second-to-last and so on? did you reverse
the string and then compare them? there are several different
ways that you can determine if a string is a palindrome by hand.

and now that you’ve done it by hand, can you write code to do the
same thing? in the two example solutions that i described, i
basically explained an algorithm that you can use to solve this
problem by hand. and that means it’s easy to write code to solve
it.

the key with this technique is just to be as detailed and
specific as possible when solving it by hand. if you say “oh i
just know it’s a palindrome”, then that’s not very helpful. how
do you know? if you’re struggling to think about it, pick a
larger input to solve by hand. something that you can’t do in
your head.

for example, if i asked you to multiply two numbers, it would be
silly to use the example of 3*4, since presumably you have that
memorized from doing multiplication tables in elementary school.
a far better example would be 14235 * 2512. with this, it is very
unlikely that you’ll be able to do it in your head so you have to
write it out. this will help you identify the “algorithm” that
you’re using.

------------------------------------------------------
4. brainstorm different data structures and algorithms
------------------------------------------------------

sometimes the easiest way to approach a coding interview question
is to take different common solutions and see if any of them
apply. we can do exactly this in coding interviews by
brainstorming different data structures and algorithms and seeing
if any of them are a good fit for our problem.

let’s say that we have a problem that involves strings. for
example, maybe we want to all the strings in an array that have a
certain prefix. let’s brainstorm:

* just keep the strings in the array. we iterate through the
array and just check the prefix of each string.
* add all the strings to a hashmap with mappings for each
possible prefix. that might work but there are a lot of
possibilities.
* we could sort the array of strings. that might make things
easier.
* maybe we could do some sort of tree structure?
* speaking of trees, what if we used a trie?

from this basic brainstorm, we’ve come up with multiple valid
possibilities. in this case, the problem that we’re looking at
does have many possible solutions, so that’s to be expected. even
if we only had one way to solve the problem, though, this may
help elucidate ways in which we can approach it.

the key is that no idea is too dumb when you’re brainstorming.
you’re doing this in front of your interviewer, so the temptation
is to try and sound smart, but you can very easily shoot yourself
in the foot by doing this. if you filter yourself while
brainstorming, you may miss key insights.

put everything down on the whiteboard and then see if anything
jumps out at you. can you make any clear connections? this
technique is great for sparking ideas.

--------------------------------------------
5. consider all the information you’re given
--------------------------------------------

lots of times, our interviewers give us clues as to how we should
think about a problem. by giving us details about how the input
is formatted or any restrictions on the input, they are subtly
hinting at how to view the problem.

for example, let’s say that we wanted to find a value in a sorted
matrix. if we know that the rows and columns of the matrix are in
sorted order, that gives us a big clue for how we can solve the
problem.

without that information, we’re fairly limited in how we can
approach this problem. our best bet would be to just iterate over
every value in the matrix to see if the value we’re searching for
exists. however, we have a big clue, which is that our matrix is
sorted.

knowing the matrix is sorted, we have algorithms to help us deal
with that. there’s binary search and we can also consider other
properties of our matrix. for example, since both rows and
columns are sorted, if we pick an arbitrary cell [i, j], any cell
and is going to have a value less than cell [i, j].

from the information given, if you’re stuck, you can simply take
some time to extrapolate everything you can. if the array is
sorted, what does that mean? if the input is in tree format, how
can we use that to our advantage? look for these clues.

-----------------------
6. simplify the problem
-----------------------

my favorite types of problems to ask as an interviewer are
problems that have a lot of moving pieces. these force the
interviewee to consider not only each part of the problem, but
how all of the different components interact with each other.

as an interviewer, this is great because i get a better idea of
an interviewee’s mental model. as an interviewee, however, it can
be difficult. whenever you see a problem that has a lot of
different stuff going on, a good starting point is to consider a
simpler problem.

let’s say that we want to find the path through a matrix with the
greatest product. this is a moderately difficult problem, but it
is complicated even more if you consider that values in your
matrix can be negative. since multiplying negatives cancel each
other out, this problem gets pretty tricky pretty fast.

but here’s the thing. the solution is not fundamentally different
than solving the problem for only positive numbers. if you get
the solution for solely positive values, then it is relatively
easy to extend the solution to include negative numbers as well.

similar to first working through a brute force solution, solving
a simpler version of the problem gives you a really good starting
point from which to build out your solution. it is often simply a
matter of handling additional input values and adding some
conditionals. once you have the framework, this is easy to do.

------------------------------------------
7. break down the problem into subproblems
------------------------------------------

in addition to simplifying problems, you can also just ignore
parts of the problem when you’re initially coming up with a
solution. this is my favorite technique when people do it right.

when you are asked a problem and are trying to come up with a
solution, ask yourself the following question: “is there any
function that, if i had access to it, would make it significantly
easier to solve this problem?”

oftentimes, you will find that there is an obvious function that
dramatically simplifies the problem. consider the example of
printing a linked list in reverse order. there should be two
obvious functions that would simplify this problem:
reverselinkedlist() and printlinkedlist(). if we already had
these functions, our solution becomes trivial.

void printreversedlinkedlist(node linkedlist) {

linkedlist = reverselinkedlist(linkedlist);

printlinkedlist(linkedlist);

// optionally, we can reverse our linked list again to return
it to the original state

}

our code really can’t get much simpler than that. and now that we
have our top-level function laid out, we can focus on
implementing each of these functions individually. this won’t
necessarily be trivial – reversing a linked list is a bit tricky
– but it will be a hell of a lot easier than what we were doing
before.

the key with this technique is that by breaking down the problem
into smaller components, it is much easier to see how to solve
the problem. you can start by just assuming that you have a
function that does x. now you only have to worry about doing all
of the other things. this abstraction makes it much easier to
reason about the problem.

and this technique also has an ancillary benefit. if you don’t
finish writing all of the code, it is still clear that you know
what you’re doing. if you choose to use a helper function, you
should implement that last. by implementing the core code first,
it is clear you know what’s up, and if you run out of time to
implement the helper function, chances are that was something
that would be pretty easy to do anyway. this is a great way to
compensate for lack of time/speed in an interview.

-------------------
8. take a step back
-------------------

going down a rabbit hole is one of the easiest ways to get stuck
in a coding interview. however, it’s not always obvious in the
moment that you’ve even gone down a rabbit hole in the first
place. that’s why i recommend that whenever you find yourself
starting to get stuck in a coding interview, you take a moment to
step back and look at the big picture.

let’s say that we realize that we need a function that stores
value mappings. for example we have something like int -&gt; string.
our initial solution might be to create a hashmap to store these
values. that would seem to be the logical thing.

however, we later discover that all of the integer keys are each
of the values from 0-n and we are going to want to be able to
iterate over the keys in order. now our hashmap doesn’t seem so
great, right?

however, i can’t tell you how many people i see who will just
take what they already have and try and force it to work. they’re
trying to put a square peg in a round hole. you can do it, but
it’s a lot of work.

first they have to get a list of all of the keys in the hashmap,
then they have to sort it, and then they have to iterate over it.
and that’s not to mention the extra work of putting everything
into a hashmap in the first place.

if they just used an array, it would be so much easier.

however, this is not always obvious. we tend to think about
problems in an iterative way, building up to a solution. that
means that if we don’t stop to think carefully about what we’re
doing, we may end up doing a lot of unnecessary work.

taking a step back is simply taking a moment to think about what
we’re doing at a high level and confirming that it is, in fact,
the best way that we could be accomplishing that task. you may be
surprised how often you don’t realize that there is a vastly more
efficient approach.

------------------------------------
9. collaborate with your interviewer
------------------------------------

many people see interviewing as a battle. it’s you versus the
interviewer. you’re trying to get the job and they’re trying to
take it away from you. you want to succeed and they want you to
fail.

this is one of the most destructive things that you can think in
your interview. this is completely false and it can change the
tone of the interview to be combative, which isn’t fun for
anyone.

the truth is that your interviewer wants you to succeed. their
goal is simply to make sure that you meet the standards that the
company has. if they’re being hard on you it’s because they’re
trying to make absolutely sure.

when you’re stuck on a problem, you can get feedback from your
interviewer. the more you talk out loud in your interview, the
more they will already know what’s going on, too, so the more
they will be able to help you.

one of my favorite phrases to use in an interview is simply,
“does that sound good to you?” when i come up with a solution and
i’m not sure if it’s the best, i’ll ask that question, which
gives my interviewer two options.

* if i’ve found a decent solution, they can say yes and suggest
that i start coding it up. this way i don’t waste any unnecessary
time trying to come up with an even better solution.
* if they’re not happy with my solution, they can say no and
suggest that i think about it a little more. this is helpful too
because, without really giving a hint at all, they are saying
that i’m not quite there yet.

granted, not all interviewers are going to be quite so helpful,
but there is no harm in asking and it can make your life a lot
easier.

----------------
10. ask for help
----------------

i’ve included this last because it’s definitely a last resort.
most interviewers will mark you down for needing a hint in your
interview. however, if you’re stuck and not making progress, this
is better than just twiddling your thumbs. and it doesn’t
necessarily disqualify you from getting an offer.

when you’re really stuck and not able to proceed, you can just be
upfront with your interviewer. tell them that you’re a little
stuck and ask if they can give you a hint. chances are, they’ll
offer you up something that will help you keep moving in the
right direction.

the worst thing that you can do in your interview is to give up
rather than asking for help. in the real world, there are plenty
of opportunities to get help from others, but no company wants to
have a quitter on their team. if you just give up when faced with
a hard problem, that’s definitely not what they want.

you’re not going to use all of these strategies in every
interview. they’re simply not necessary.

sometimes you’ll see a really easy problem and you won’t need to
use any of them. sometimes you’ll get a really hard problem and
have to combine several strategies.

regardless of the specific interview question, though, knowing
these strategies will make you bulletproof against even the
toughest questions.

so i want you to do something right now. pick one of these
strategies and try it out for yourself right now. we went over a
ton of stuff today so start with just picking one. i guarantee
you’ll see a big difference.

best,

sam

engineering. whether via email with a new subscriber to this list
or someone who has been around for the last year and a half, or
in person with one of my coaching clients, i see all different
shades of software engineers.

however, every single software engineer that i talk to aspires to
the same thing: a job at a great company.

i love this. there are so many places on the internet that
attract software engineers that just want a job to get by.

here’s a reddit post from a year ago:

(if you don't see images below, click ""display images"")

( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/7qh7h8h8qdzzk/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuynl0zs1ies1iexrllmnvbs9jaw0tzhluyw1pyy1wcm9ncmftbwluzy8= )

i find posts like this fascinating because of how they tend to
polarize people. on forums like reddit, there are posts like
this, from someone who obviously gets the value of having a
meaningful job, and then there are lots comments of jealousy from
people wishing that they could have a job like that where they
don’t have to do any work.

i love the readers of byte by byte because you don’t think that
way. you know what you really want, whether it’s a big 4 or a hot
startup. my job is just to show you how to get there.

however, here’s the problem. just knowing what you want is not
enough. there are tons of people out there gunning for the same
jobs. while the number is probably a little skewed down, google
has an acceptance rate of ~1%. that means out of 100
interviewees, you need to be the best.

when you’re interviewing at companies like google, just having a
vague understanding of a topic isn’t going to cut it. you need to
understand every topic backwards and forwards.

this is why i created coding interview mastery: dynamic
programming ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/75u7h8hp6o56g/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ). after seeing so many
of my students putting in tons of effort only to still fail, i
wanted to ensure that there was a better way to learn dynamic
programming.

with topics that counterintuitive, you might put in tens of hours
only to realize you’ve barely made a dent in it and you can still
only solve the most basic of problems. cim: dynamic programming (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/o2ikhqhl6rd6z/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ) takes everything that you need to
know for your interview and packages in such a way that you can
not only quickly understand it, but easily remember it in the
heat of the interview.

if you’re serious about interviewing, you’re going to put in many
hours into studying and preparing. however, even with all the
hours you’re putting in, there are so many different topics that
it’s not like you’re actually spending a whole lot of time on any
one.

when you spend weeks on dynamic programming, that’s time that
you’re taking away from other topics that you need to study.
remember that you need to be very strong on every topic to get
the job at google.

ultimately, as i talked about last week, this is an opportunity
to invest in yourself. while no one is forcing you to do so,
recognize how not making this investment will affect your life.
you will continue studying dynamic programming. maybe you’ll
figure it out. maybe you won’t. maybe you’ll get the job. maybe
you won’t.

but regardless of the outcome, you will invest large amounts of
your time. time that no amount of money can bring back. chances
are, you’ll realize later that you actually needed this course,
and you’ll have wasted time and then still spend the money to
purchase the course.

this is why you should invest in this course today (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/zefghnhrk3xkg/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ). not tomorrow, not next week. the
longer you put it off, the more time you waste.

if you’re ready to get the job you’ve dreamed of and nail dynamic
programming once and for all, join the course here. (

In fact, I&#39;ve found through working with","[<p>hi sunny khandare -

yesterday i told you about the #1 thing that people screw up in
their interviews: they don’t know what to do if they get stuck.

in fact, i’ve found through working with dozens of students that
many people don’t even know how to approach a new problem.
rather, they simply go into the interview and hope that a
solution magically appears to them.

this is not a good strategy.

if your interviewer knows what they’re doing, they will
specifically ask you a question where the solution is nonobvious.
that doesn’t mean you have to be a genius to be able to solve it,
but you do have to have a structured approach.

when you see a problem that you don’t recognize, what is your
plan? here are 10 strategies to keep in your back pocket in case
you get stuck during your interview.

------------------------------
1. find a brute force solution
------------------------------

there’s probably one reason above all others that causes
candidates to get stuck finding a solution: they try to
immediately find an optimal solution.

i’ve discussed starting with brute force solutions (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/reh8hoh5qdn7x/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuynl0zs1ies1iexrllmnvbs9icnv0zs1mb3jjzq== ) in the past, but it bears
repeating. it is very easy to go down different rabbit holes when
trying to find an optimal solution and finding a brute force
solution always gives you a grounded place to come back to. even
though it may not be a great solution, if you can’t find a better
solution, it gives you something to fall back on.

the brute force solution also gives you a jumping-off point to
optimize your code. with a brute force solution, it is often easy
to see places in which you are doing repeated work or otherwise
slowing down the execution.

after finding the brute force solution, you can use gayle
laackmann mcdowell’s bud optimization (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/8kuqhoh5gdk3k/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuc2xpzgvzagfyzs5uzxqvz2f5bguyl2nyywnraw5nlxrozs1pbnrlcnzpzxctc2tpbgxzlwnvzgluzy1zb2z0lxnrawxscy1wcm9kdwn0lw1hbmfnzw1lbnqtagfuzg91dhm= ), which stands for bottlenecks,
unnecessary work, and duplicated work. by identifying places in
your code that are slowing everything else down, you can find
ways in which to optimize the code.

for example, if you’re looping through an array and for each
element, you need to look up that element in another array, you
have an o(n * m) time complexity, if n and m are the lengths of
the two arrays. however, if you put the second array into a set,
you get a lookup time of o(1), so your time complexity improves
to o(n).

finding a brute force solution is incredibly valuable, because it
helps you understand the problem better and ensures that you have
a solution.

-------------------------------
2. fully understand the problem
-------------------------------

it is shocking to me how many people will start trying to solve
an interview problem without really understanding what they’re
supposed to do.

in fact, when evaluating new coaching clients, i always ask them
to simply print a linked list in reverse order. this should be a
very simple task, but many people miss the core directive, which
is to print the list. i often find people trying to return a
reversed list or other such things. however, that is not what i
am asking and can be significantly more difficult.

when problems are more complicated or confusing, i often find
that people will spend a few minutes trying to understand the
problem, but eventually give up and figure they’ll just start
solving it. that’s a critical mistake, though. how can you solve
a problem when you don’t know what you’re solving?

there are a couple things that you can do if you’re struggling to
understand a coding interview question. the first is to simply
ask more questions of your interviewer. ask them to show you an
example or clarify any specific points on which you’re unclear.
don’t feel bad about asking a lot of questions. it’s their job to
make you understand what to do.

you can also work through a few examples. look at what the inputs
and outputs are. what is the function signature going to be?
explicitly defining these parameters can be very helpful in
thinking about the problem. for example, if you’re writing a
recursive function, it’s way easier to figure out the base case
when you know what the return type should be.

-----------------------------------
3. work through the problem by hand
-----------------------------------

not sure how to solve the problem in a coding interview? well can
you solve the problem yourself without writing any code? if you
understand the problem thoroughly, you should be able to answer
it. and if you can solve it by hand, you can solve it with code.

let’s consider the example of determining whether a string is a
palindrome. say i give you the string “acaramanamaraca”. is it a
palindrome? go ahead and decide.

how did you solve it? did you compare the first and last letters,
then the second and the second-to-last and so on? did you reverse
the string and then compare them? there are several different
ways that you can determine if a string is a palindrome by hand.

and now that you’ve done it by hand, can you write code to do the
same thing? in the two example solutions that i described, i
basically explained an algorithm that you can use to solve this
problem by hand. and that means it’s easy to write code to solve
it.

the key with this technique is just to be as detailed and
specific as possible when solving it by hand. if you say “oh i
just know it’s a palindrome”, then that’s not very helpful. how
do you know? if you’re struggling to think about it, pick a
larger input to solve by hand. something that you can’t do in
your head.

for example, if i asked you to multiply two numbers, it would be
silly to use the example of 3*4, since presumably you have that
memorized from doing multiplication tables in elementary school.
a far better example would be 14235 * 2512. with this, it is very
unlikely that you’ll be able to do it in your head so you have to
write it out. this will help you identify the “algorithm” that
you’re using.

------------------------------------------------------
4. brainstorm different data structures and algorithms
------------------------------------------------------

sometimes the easiest way to approach a coding interview question
is to take different common solutions and see if any of them
apply. we can do exactly this in coding interviews by
brainstorming different data structures and algorithms and seeing
if any of them are a good fit for our problem.

let’s say that we have a problem that involves strings. for
example, maybe we want to all the strings in an array that have a
certain prefix. let’s brainstorm:

* just keep the strings in the array. we iterate through the
array and just check the prefix of each string.
* add all the strings to a hashmap with mappings for each
possible prefix. that might work but there are a lot of
possibilities.
* we could sort the array of strings. that might make things
easier.
* maybe we could do some sort of tree structure?
* speaking of trees, what if we used a trie?

from this basic brainstorm, we’ve come up with multiple valid
possibilities. in this case, the problem that we’re looking at
does have many possible solutions, so that’s to be expected. even
if we only had one way to solve the problem, though, this may
help elucidate ways in which we can approach it.

the key is that no idea is too dumb when you’re brainstorming.
you’re doing this in front of your interviewer, so the temptation
is to try and sound smart, but you can very easily shoot yourself
in the foot by doing this. if you filter yourself while
brainstorming, you may miss key insights.

put everything down on the whiteboard and then see if anything
jumps out at you. can you make any clear connections? this
technique is great for sparking ideas.

--------------------------------------------
5. consider all the information you’re given
--------------------------------------------

lots of times, our interviewers give us clues as to how we should
think about a problem. by giving us details about how the input
is formatted or any restrictions on the input, they are subtly
hinting at how to view the problem.

for example, let’s say that we wanted to find a value in a sorted
matrix. if we know that the rows and columns of the matrix are in
sorted order, that gives us a big clue for how we can solve the
problem.

without that information, we’re fairly limited in how we can
approach this problem. our best bet would be to just iterate over
every value in the matrix to see if the value we’re searching for
exists. however, we have a big clue, which is that our matrix is
sorted.

knowing the matrix is sorted, we have algorithms to help us deal
with that. there’s binary search and we can also consider other
properties of our matrix. for example, since both rows and
columns are sorted, if we pick an arbitrary cell [i, j], any cell
and is going to have a value less than cell [i, j].

from the information given, if you’re stuck, you can simply take
some time to extrapolate everything you can. if the array is
sorted, what does that mean? if the input is in tree format, how
can we use that to our advantage? look for these clues.

-----------------------
6. simplify the problem
-----------------------

my favorite types of problems to ask as an interviewer are
problems that have a lot of moving pieces. these force the
interviewee to consider not only each part of the problem, but
how all of the different components interact with each other.

as an interviewer, this is great because i get a better idea of
an interviewee’s mental model. as an interviewee, however, it can
be difficult. whenever you see a problem that has a lot of
different stuff going on, a good starting point is to consider a
simpler problem.

let’s say that we want to find the path through a matrix with the
greatest product. this is a moderately difficult problem, but it
is complicated even more if you consider that values in your
matrix can be negative. since multiplying negatives cancel each
other out, this problem gets pretty tricky pretty fast.

but here’s the thing. the solution is not fundamentally different
than solving the problem for only positive numbers. if you get
the solution for solely positive values, then it is relatively
easy to extend the solution to include negative numbers as well.

similar to first working through a brute force solution, solving
a simpler version of the problem gives you a really good starting
point from which to build out your solution. it is often simply a
matter of handling additional input values and adding some
conditionals. once you have the framework, this is easy to do.

------------------------------------------
7. break down the problem into subproblems
------------------------------------------

in addition to simplifying problems, you can also just ignore
parts of the problem when you’re initially coming up with a
solution. this is my favorite technique when people do it right.

when you are asked a problem and are trying to come up with a
solution, ask yourself the following question: “is there any
function that, if i had access to it, would make it significantly
easier to solve this problem?”

oftentimes, you will find that there is an obvious function that
dramatically simplifies the problem. consider the example of
printing a linked list in reverse order. there should be two
obvious functions that would simplify this problem:
reverselinkedlist() and printlinkedlist(). if we already had
these functions, our solution becomes trivial.

void printreversedlinkedlist(node linkedlist) {

linkedlist = reverselinkedlist(linkedlist);

printlinkedlist(linkedlist);

// optionally, we can reverse our linked list again to return
it to the original state

}

our code really can’t get much simpler than that. and now that we
have our top-level function laid out, we can focus on
implementing each of these functions individually. this won’t
necessarily be trivial – reversing a linked list is a bit tricky
– but it will be a hell of a lot easier than what we were doing
before.

the key with this technique is that by breaking down the problem
into smaller components, it is much easier to see how to solve
the problem. you can start by just assuming that you have a
function that does x. now you only have to worry about doing all
of the other things. this abstraction makes it much easier to
reason about the problem.

and this technique also has an ancillary benefit. if you don’t
finish writing all of the code, it is still clear that you know
what you’re doing. if you choose to use a helper function, you
should implement that last. by implementing the core code first,
it is clear you know what’s up, and if you run out of time to
implement the helper function, chances are that was something
that would be pretty easy to do anyway. this is a great way to
compensate for lack of time/speed in an interview.

-------------------
8. take a step back
-------------------

going down a rabbit hole is one of the easiest ways to get stuck
in a coding interview. however, it’s not always obvious in the
moment that you’ve even gone down a rabbit hole in the first
place. that’s why i recommend that whenever you find yourself
starting to get stuck in a coding interview, you take a moment to
step back and look at the big picture.

let’s say that we realize that we need a function that stores
value mappings. for example we have something like int -&gt; string.
our initial solution might be to create a hashmap to store these
values. that would seem to be the logical thing.

however, we later discover that all of the integer keys are each
of the values from 0-n and we are going to want to be able to
iterate over the keys in order. now our hashmap doesn’t seem so
great, right?

however, i can’t tell you how many people i see who will just
take what they already have and try and force it to work. they’re
trying to put a square peg in a round hole. you can do it, but
it’s a lot of work.

first they have to get a list of all of the keys in the hashmap,
then they have to sort it, and then they have to iterate over it.
and that’s not to mention the extra work of putting everything
into a hashmap in the first place.

if they just used an array, it would be so much easier.

however, this is not always obvious. we tend to think about
problems in an iterative way, building up to a solution. that
means that if we don’t stop to think carefully about what we’re
doing, we may end up doing a lot of unnecessary work.

taking a step back is simply taking a moment to think about what
we’re doing at a high level and confirming that it is, in fact,
the best way that we could be accomplishing that task. you may be
surprised how often you don’t realize that there is a vastly more
efficient approach.

------------------------------------
9. collaborate with your interviewer
------------------------------------

many people see interviewing as a battle. it’s you versus the
interviewer. you’re trying to get the job and they’re trying to
take it away from you. you want to succeed and they want you to
fail.

this is one of the most destructive things that you can think in
your interview. this is completely false and it can change the
tone of the interview to be combative, which isn’t fun for
anyone.

the truth is that your interviewer wants you to succeed. their
goal is simply to make sure that you meet the standards that the
company has. if they’re being hard on you it’s because they’re
trying to make absolutely sure.

when you’re stuck on a problem, you can get feedback from your
interviewer. the more you talk out loud in your interview, the
more they will already know what’s going on, too, so the more
they will be able to help you.

one of my favorite phrases to use in an interview is simply,
“does that sound good to you?” when i come up with a solution and
i’m not sure if it’s the best, i’ll ask that question, which
gives my interviewer two options.

* if i’ve found a decent solution, they can say yes and suggest
that i start coding it up. this way i don’t waste any unnecessary
time trying to come up with an even better solution.
* if they’re not happy with my solution, they can say no and
suggest that i think about it a little more. this is helpful too
because, without really giving a hint at all, they are saying
that i’m not quite there yet.

granted, not all interviewers are going to be quite so helpful,
but there is no harm in asking and it can make your life a lot
easier.

----------------
10. ask for help
----------------

i’ve included this last because it’s definitely a last resort.
most interviewers will mark you down for needing a hint in your
interview. however, if you’re stuck and not making progress, this
is better than just twiddling your thumbs. and it doesn’t
necessarily disqualify you from getting an offer.

when you’re really stuck and not able to proceed, you can just be
upfront with your interviewer. tell them that you’re a little
stuck and ask if they can give you a hint. chances are, they’ll
offer you up something that will help you keep moving in the
right direction.

the worst thing that you can do in your interview is to give up
rather than asking for help. in the real world, there are plenty
of opportunities to get help from others, but no company wants to
have a quitter on their team. if you just give up when faced with
a hard problem, that’s definitely not what they want.

you’re not going to use all of these strategies in every
interview. they’re simply not necessary.

sometimes you’ll see a really easy problem and you won’t need to
use any of them. sometimes you’ll get a really hard problem and
have to combine several strategies.

regardless of the specific interview question, though, knowing
these strategies will make you bulletproof against even the
toughest questions.

so i want you to do something right now. pick one of these
strategies and try it out for yourself right now. we went over a
ton of stuff today so start with just picking one. i guarantee
you’ll see a big difference.

best,

sam

1664501a8d4a5a72,sam gavis-hughson <sam+qotd@byte-by-byte.com>,this is the skill google engineers have mastered...will you?,2018-10-05,"Hey Sunny Khandare - Every day, I talk to people about careers in software engineering. Whether via email with a new subscriber to this list or someone who has been around for the last year and a half,","[<p>hey sunny khandare -

every day, i talk to people about careers in software
engineering. whether via email with a new subscriber to this list
or someone who has been around for the last year and a half, or
in person with one of my coaching clients, i see all different
shades of software engineers.

however, every single software engineer that i talk to aspires to
the same thing: a job at a great company.

i love this. there are so many places on the internet that
attract software engineers that just want a job to get by.

here’s a reddit post from a year ago:

(if you don't see images below, click ""display images"")

( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/7qh7h8h8qdzzk/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuynl0zs1ies1iexrllmnvbs9jaw0tzhluyw1pyy1wcm9ncmftbwluzy8= )

i find posts like this fascinating because of how they tend to
polarize people. on forums like reddit, there are posts like
this, from someone who obviously gets the value of having a
meaningful job, and then there are lots comments of jealousy from
people wishing that they could have a job like that where they
don’t have to do any work.

i love the readers of byte by byte because you don’t think that
way. you know what you really want, whether it’s a big 4 or a hot
startup. my job is just to show you how to get there.

however, here’s the problem. just knowing what you want is not
enough. there are tons of people out there gunning for the same
jobs. while the number is probably a little skewed down, google
has an acceptance rate of ~1%. that means out of 100
interviewees, you need to be the best.

when you’re interviewing at companies like google, just having a
vague understanding of a topic isn’t going to cut it. you need to
understand every topic backwards and forwards.

this is why i created coding interview mastery: dynamic
programming ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/75u7h8hp6o56g/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ). after seeing so many
of my students putting in tons of effort only to still fail, i
wanted to ensure that there was a better way to learn dynamic
programming.

with topics that counterintuitive, you might put in tens of hours
only to realize you’ve barely made a dent in it and you can still
only solve the most basic of problems. cim: dynamic programming (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/o2ikhqhl6rd6z/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ) takes everything that you need to
know for your interview and packages in such a way that you can
not only quickly understand it, but easily remember it in the
heat of the interview.

if you’re serious about interviewing, you’re going to put in many
hours into studying and preparing. however, even with all the
hours you’re putting in, there are so many different topics that
it’s not like you’re actually spending a whole lot of time on any
one.

when you spend weeks on dynamic programming, that’s time that
you’re taking away from other topics that you need to study.
remember that you need to be very strong on every topic to get
the job at google.

ultimately, as i talked about last week, this is an opportunity
to invest in yourself. while no one is forcing you to do so,
recognize how not making this investment will affect your life.
you will continue studying dynamic programming. maybe you’ll
figure it out. maybe you won’t. maybe you’ll get the job. maybe
you won’t.

but regardless of the outcome, you will invest large amounts of
your time. time that no amount of money can bring back. chances
are, you’ll realize later that you actually needed this course,
and you’ll have wasted time and then still spend the money to
purchase the course.

this is why you should invest in this course today (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/zefghnhrk3xkg/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ). not tomorrow, not next week. the
longer you put it off, the more time you waste.

if you’re ready to get the job you’ve dreamed of and nail dynamic
programming once and for all, join the course here. (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/pxteh9h52zo2v/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz )

In fact, I&#39;ve found through working with","[<p>hi sunny khandare -

yesterday i told you about the #1 thing that people screw up in
their interviews: they don’t know what to do if they get stuck.

in fact, i’ve found through working with dozens of students that
many people don’t even know how to approach a new problem.
rather, they simply go into the interview and hope that a
solution magically appears to them.

this is not a good strategy.

if your interviewer knows what they’re doing, they will
specifically ask you a question where the solution is nonobvious.
that doesn’t mean you have to be a genius to be able to solve it,
but you do have to have a structured approach.

when you see a problem that you don’t recognize, what is your
plan? here are 10 strategies to keep in your back pocket in case
you get stuck during your interview.

------------------------------
1. find a brute force solution
------------------------------

there’s probably one reason above all others that causes
candidates to get stuck finding a solution: they try to
immediately find an optimal solution.

i’ve discussed starting with brute force solutions (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/reh8hoh5qdn7x/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuynl0zs1ies1iexrllmnvbs9icnv0zs1mb3jjzq== ) in the past, but it bears
repeating. it is very easy to go down different rabbit holes when
trying to find an optimal solution and finding a brute force
solution always gives you a grounded place to come back to. even
though it may not be a great solution, if you can’t find a better
solution, it gives you something to fall back on.

the brute force solution also gives you a jumping-off point to
optimize your code. with a brute force solution, it is often easy
to see places in which you are doing repeated work or otherwise
slowing down the execution.

after finding the brute force solution, you can use gayle
laackmann mcdowell’s bud optimization (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/8kuqhoh5gdk3k/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuc2xpzgvzagfyzs5uzxqvz2f5bguyl2nyywnraw5nlxrozs1pbnrlcnzpzxctc2tpbgxzlwnvzgluzy1zb2z0lxnrawxscy1wcm9kdwn0lw1hbmfnzw1lbnqtagfuzg91dhm= ), which stands for bottlenecks,
unnecessary work, and duplicated work. by identifying places in
your code that are slowing everything else down, you can find
ways in which to optimize the code.

for example, if you’re looping through an array and for each
element, you need to look up that element in another array, you
have an o(n * m) time complexity, if n and m are the lengths of
the two arrays. however, if you put the second array into a set,
you get a lookup time of o(1), so your time complexity improves
to o(n).

finding a brute force solution is incredibly valuable, because it
helps you understand the problem better and ensures that you have
a solution.

-------------------------------
2. fully understand the problem
-------------------------------

it is shocking to me how many people will start trying to solve
an interview problem without really understanding what they’re
supposed to do.

in fact, when evaluating new coaching clients, i always ask them
to simply print a linked list in reverse order. this should be a
very simple task, but many people miss the core directive, which
is to print the list. i often find people trying to return a
reversed list or other such things. however, that is not what i
am asking and can be significantly more difficult.

when problems are more complicated or confusing, i often find
that people will spend a few minutes trying to understand the
problem, but eventually give up and figure they’ll just start
solving it. that’s a critical mistake, though. how can you solve
a problem when you don’t know what you’re solving?

there are a couple things that you can do if you’re struggling to
understand a coding interview question. the first is to simply
ask more questions of your interviewer. ask them to show you an
example or clarify any specific points on which you’re unclear.
don’t feel bad about asking a lot of questions. it’s their job to
make you understand what to do.

you can also work through a few examples. look at what the inputs
and outputs are. what is the function signature going to be?
explicitly defining these parameters can be very helpful in
thinking about the problem. for example, if you’re writing a
recursive function, it’s way easier to figure out the base case
when you know what the return type should be.

-----------------------------------
3. work through the problem by hand
-----------------------------------

not sure how to solve the problem in a coding interview? well can
you solve the problem yourself without writing any code? if you
understand the problem thoroughly, you should be able to answer
it. and if you can solve it by hand, you can solve it with code.

let’s consider the example of determining whether a string is a
palindrome. say i give you the string “acaramanamaraca”. is it a
palindrome? go ahead and decide.

how did you solve it? did you compare the first and last letters,
then the second and the second-to-last and so on? did you reverse
the string and then compare them? there are several different
ways that you can determine if a string is a palindrome by hand.

and now that you’ve done it by hand, can you write code to do the
same thing? in the two example solutions that i described, i
basically explained an algorithm that you can use to solve this
problem by hand. and that means it’s easy to write code to solve
it.

the key with this technique is just to be as detailed and
specific as possible when solving it by hand. if you say “oh i
just know it’s a palindrome”, then that’s not very helpful. how
do you know? if you’re struggling to think about it, pick a
larger input to solve by hand. something that you can’t do in
your head.

for example, if i asked you to multiply two numbers, it would be
silly to use the example of 3*4, since presumably you have that
memorized from doing multiplication tables in elementary school.
a far better example would be 14235 * 2512. with this, it is very
unlikely that you’ll be able to do it in your head so you have to
write it out. this will help you identify the “algorithm” that
you’re using.

------------------------------------------------------
4. brainstorm different data structures and algorithms
------------------------------------------------------

sometimes the easiest way to approach a coding interview question
is to take different common solutions and see if any of them
apply. we can do exactly this in coding interviews by
brainstorming different data structures and algorithms and seeing
if any of them are a good fit for our problem.

let’s say that we have a problem that involves strings. for
example, maybe we want to all the strings in an array that have a
certain prefix. let’s brainstorm:

* just keep the strings in the array. we iterate through the
array and just check the prefix of each string.
* add all the strings to a hashmap with mappings for each
possible prefix. that might work but there are a lot of
possibilities.
* we could sort the array of strings. that might make things
easier.
* maybe we could do some sort of tree structure?
* speaking of trees, what if we used a trie?

from this basic brainstorm, we’ve come up with multiple valid
possibilities. in this case, the problem that we’re looking at
does have many possible solutions, so that’s to be expected. even
if we only had one way to solve the problem, though, this may
help elucidate ways in which we can approach it.

the key is that no idea is too dumb when you’re brainstorming.
you’re doing this in front of your interviewer, so the temptation
is to try and sound smart, but you can very easily shoot yourself
in the foot by doing this. if you filter yourself while
brainstorming, you may miss key insights.

put everything down on the whiteboard and then see if anything
jumps out at you. can you make any clear connections? this
technique is great for sparking ideas.

--------------------------------------------
5. consider all the information you’re given
--------------------------------------------

lots of times, our interviewers give us clues as to how we should
think about a problem. by giving us details about how the input
is formatted or any restrictions on the input, they are subtly
hinting at how to view the problem.

for example, let’s say that we wanted to find a value in a sorted
matrix. if we know that the rows and columns of the matrix are in
sorted order, that gives us a big clue for how we can solve the
problem.

without that information, we’re fairly limited in how we can
approach this problem. our best bet would be to just iterate over
every value in the matrix to see if the value we’re searching for
exists. however, we have a big clue, which is that our matrix is
sorted.

knowing the matrix is sorted, we have algorithms to help us deal
with that. there’s binary search and we can also consider other
properties of our matrix. for example, since both rows and
columns are sorted, if we pick an arbitrary cell [i, j], any cell
and is going to have a value less than cell [i, j].

from the information given, if you’re stuck, you can simply take
some time to extrapolate everything you can. if the array is
sorted, what does that mean? if the input is in tree format, how
can we use that to our advantage? look for these clues.

-----------------------
6. simplify the problem
-----------------------

my favorite types of problems to ask as an interviewer are
problems that have a lot of moving pieces. these force the
interviewee to consider not only each part of the problem, but
how all of the different components interact with each other.

as an interviewer, this is great because i get a better idea of
an interviewee’s mental model. as an interviewee, however, it can
be difficult. whenever you see a problem that has a lot of
different stuff going on, a good starting point is to consider a
simpler problem.

let’s say that we want to find the path through a matrix with the
greatest product. this is a moderately difficult problem, but it
is complicated even more if you consider that values in your
matrix can be negative. since multiplying negatives cancel each
other out, this problem gets pretty tricky pretty fast.

but here’s the thing. the solution is not fundamentally different
than solving the problem for only positive numbers. if you get
the solution for solely positive values, then it is relatively
easy to extend the solution to include negative numbers as well.

similar to first working through a brute force solution, solving
a simpler version of the problem gives you a really good starting
point from which to build out your solution. it is often simply a
matter of handling additional input values and adding some
conditionals. once you have the framework, this is easy to do.

------------------------------------------
7. break down the problem into subproblems
------------------------------------------

in addition to simplifying problems, you can also just ignore
parts of the problem when you’re initially coming up with a
solution. this is my favorite technique when people do it right.

when you are asked a problem and are trying to come up with a
solution, ask yourself the following question: “is there any
function that, if i had access to it, would make it significantly
easier to solve this problem?”

oftentimes, you will find that there is an obvious function that
dramatically simplifies the problem. consider the example of
printing a linked list in reverse order. there should be two
obvious functions that would simplify this problem:
reverselinkedlist() and printlinkedlist(). if we already had
these functions, our solution becomes trivial.

void printreversedlinkedlist(node linkedlist) {

linkedlist = reverselinkedlist(linkedlist);

printlinkedlist(linkedlist);

// optionally, we can reverse our linked list again to return
it to the original state

}

our code really can’t get much simpler than that. and now that we
have our top-level function laid out, we can focus on
implementing each of these functions individually. this won’t
necessarily be trivial – reversing a linked list is a bit tricky
– but it will be a hell of a lot easier than what we were doing
before.

the key with this technique is that by breaking down the problem
into smaller components, it is much easier to see how to solve
the problem. you can start by just assuming that you have a
function that does x. now you only have to worry about doing all
of the other things. this abstraction makes it much easier to
reason about the problem.

and this technique also has an ancillary benefit. if you don’t
finish writing all of the code, it is still clear that you know
what you’re doing. if you choose to use a helper function, you
should implement that last. by implementing the core code first,
it is clear you know what’s up, and if you run out of time to
implement the helper function, chances are that was something
that would be pretty easy to do anyway. this is a great way to
compensate for lack of time/speed in an interview.

-------------------
8. take a step back
-------------------

going down a rabbit hole is one of the easiest ways to get stuck
in a coding interview. however, it’s not always obvious in the
moment that you’ve even gone down a rabbit hole in the first
place. that’s why i recommend that whenever you find yourself
starting to get stuck in a coding interview, you take a moment to
step back and look at the big picture.

let’s say that we realize that we need a function that stores
value mappings. for example we have something like int -&gt; string.
our initial solution might be to create a hashmap to store these
values. that would seem to be the logical thing.

however, we later discover that all of the integer keys are each
of the values from 0-n and we are going to want to be able to
iterate over the keys in order. now our hashmap doesn’t seem so
great, right?

however, i can’t tell you how many people i see who will just
take what they already have and try and force it to work. they’re
trying to put a square peg in a round hole. you can do it, but
it’s a lot of work.

first they have to get a list of all of the keys in the hashmap,
then they have to sort it, and then they have to iterate over it.
and that’s not to mention the extra work of putting everything
into a hashmap in the first place.

if they just used an array, it would be so much easier.

however, this is not always obvious. we tend to think about
problems in an iterative way, building up to a solution. that
means that if we don’t stop to think carefully about what we’re
doing, we may end up doing a lot of unnecessary work.

taking a step back is simply taking a moment to think about what
we’re doing at a high level and confirming that it is, in fact,
the best way that we could be accomplishing that task. you may be
surprised how often you don’t realize that there is a vastly more
efficient approach.

------------------------------------
9. collaborate with your interviewer
------------------------------------

many people see interviewing as a battle. it’s you versus the
interviewer. you’re trying to get the job and they’re trying to
take it away from you. you want to succeed and they want you to
fail.

this is one of the most destructive things that you can think in
your interview. this is completely false and it can change the
tone of the interview to be combative, which isn’t fun for
anyone.

the truth is that your interviewer wants you to succeed. their
goal is simply to make sure that you meet the standards that the
company has. if they’re being hard on you it’s because they’re
trying to make absolutely sure.

when you’re stuck on a problem, you can get feedback from your
interviewer. the more you talk out loud in your interview, the
more they will already know what’s going on, too, so the more
they will be able to help you.

one of my favorite phrases to use in an interview is simply,
“does that sound good to you?” when i come up with a solution and
i’m not sure if it’s the best, i’ll ask that question, which
gives my interviewer two options.

* if i’ve found a decent solution, they can say yes and suggest
that i start coding it up. this way i don’t waste any unnecessary
time trying to come up with an even better solution.
* if they’re not happy with my solution, they can say no and
suggest that i think about it a little more. this is helpful too
because, without really giving a hint at all, they are saying
that i’m not quite there yet.

granted, not all interviewers are going to be quite so helpful,
but there is no harm in asking and it can make your life a lot
easier.

----------------
10. ask for help
----------------

i’ve included this last because it’s definitely a last resort.
most interviewers will mark you down for needing a hint in your
interview. however, if you’re stuck and not making progress, this
is better than just twiddling your thumbs. and it doesn’t
necessarily disqualify you from getting an offer.

when you’re really stuck and not able to proceed, you can just be
upfront with your interviewer. tell them that you’re a little
stuck and ask if they can give you a hint. chances are, they’ll
offer you up something that will help you keep moving in the
right direction.

the worst thing that you can do in your interview is to give up
rather than asking for help. in the real world, there are plenty
of opportunities to get help from others, but no company wants to
have a quitter on their team. if you just give up when faced with
a hard problem, that’s definitely not what they want.

you’re not going to use all of these strategies in every
interview. they’re simply not necessary.

sometimes you’ll see a really easy problem and you won’t need to
use any of them. sometimes you’ll get a really hard problem and
have to combine several strategies.

regardless of the specific interview question, though, knowing
these strategies will make you bulletproof against even the
toughest questions.

so i want you to do something right now. pick one of these
strategies and try it out for yourself right now. we went over a
ton of stuff today so start with just picking one. i guarantee
you’ll see a big difference.

best,

sam

1664501a8d4a5a72,sam gavis-hughson <sam+qotd@byte-by-byte.com>,this is the skill google engineers have mastered...will you?,2018-10-05,"Hey Sunny Khandare - Every day, I talk to people about careers in software engineering. Whether via email with a new subscriber to this list or someone who has been around for the last year and a half,","[<p>hey sunny khandare -

every day, i talk to people about careers in software
engineering. whether via email with a new subscriber to this list
or someone who has been around for the last year and a half, or
in person with one of my coaching clients, i see all different
shades of software engineers.

however, every single software engineer that i talk to aspires to
the same thing: a job at a great company.

i love this. there are so many places on the internet that
attract software engineers that just want a job to get by.

here’s a reddit post from a year ago:

(if you don't see images below, click ""display images"")

( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/7qh7h8h8qdzzk/ahr0chm6ly93d3cuynl0zs1ies1iexrllmnvbs9jaw0tzhluyw1pyy1wcm9ncmftbwluzy8= )

i find posts like this fascinating because of how they tend to
polarize people. on forums like reddit, there are posts like
this, from someone who obviously gets the value of having a
meaningful job, and then there are lots comments of jealousy from
people wishing that they could have a job like that where they
don’t have to do any work.

i love the readers of byte by byte because you don’t think that
way. you know what you really want, whether it’s a big 4 or a hot
startup. my job is just to show you how to get there.

however, here’s the problem. just knowing what you want is not
enough. there are tons of people out there gunning for the same
jobs. while the number is probably a little skewed down, google
has an acceptance rate of ~1%. that means out of 100
interviewees, you need to be the best.

when you’re interviewing at companies like google, just having a
vague understanding of a topic isn’t going to cut it. you need to
understand every topic backwards and forwards.

this is why i created coding interview mastery: dynamic
programming ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/75u7h8hp6o56g/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ). after seeing so many
of my students putting in tons of effort only to still fail, i
wanted to ensure that there was a better way to learn dynamic
programming.

with topics that counterintuitive, you might put in tens of hours
only to realize you’ve barely made a dent in it and you can still
only solve the most basic of problems. cim: dynamic programming (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/o2ikhqhl6rd6z/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ) takes everything that you need to
know for your interview and packages in such a way that you can
not only quickly understand it, but easily remember it in the
heat of the interview.

if you’re serious about interviewing, you’re going to put in many
hours into studying and preparing. however, even with all the
hours you’re putting in, there are so many different topics that
it’s not like you’re actually spending a whole lot of time on any
one.

when you spend weeks on dynamic programming, that’s time that
you’re taking away from other topics that you need to study.
remember that you need to be very strong on every topic to get
the job at google.

ultimately, as i talked about last week, this is an opportunity
to invest in yourself. while no one is forcing you to do so,
recognize how not making this investment will affect your life.
you will continue studying dynamic programming. maybe you’ll
figure it out. maybe you won’t. maybe you’ll get the job. maybe
you won’t.

but regardless of the outcome, you will invest large amounts of
your time. time that no amount of money can bring back. chances
are, you’ll realize later that you actually needed this course,
and you’ll have wasted time and then still spend the money to
purchase the course.

this is why you should invest in this course today (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/zefghnhrk3xkg/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz ). not tomorrow, not next week. the
longer you put it off, the more time you waste.

if you’re ready to get the job you’ve dreamed of and nail dynamic
programming once and for all, join the course here. (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/pxteh9h52zo2v/ahr0chm6ly9zdhvkzw50cy5iexrllwj5lwj5dguuy29tl2r5bmftawmtchjvz3jhbw1pbmctc3avp3v0bv9zb3vyy2u9yxv0b3jlc3bvbmrlciz1dg1fbwvkaxvtpwvtywlsjnv0bv9jyw1wywlnbj1ldmvyz3jlzw4mdxrtx2nvbnrlbnq9zw1hawwz )
