Everyone I talk to falls along a spectrum. People range all the
way from “OMGOMG I need to spend 2 years studying so I can get my
dream job” to “Meh I’ll do a few practice problems before my
interview if I get to it”.

For most people however, interview prep is a balancing act. On
the one side, you want to do well, but on the other side you have
a life beyond practicing linked list and recursion problems all
day.

When you don’t have an infinite amount of time to dedicate, it’s
crucial to prioritize and work on the most high-value tasks. In
interviewing, those are 3 things:

* Studying data structures and algorithms
* Solving practice problems
* Mock interviews

However, just doing these things isn’t sufficient if you don’t do
them properly. That’s why I wrote a blog post diving deep into
these three areas.

-------------------------------

Hi Sunny Khandare -

Today I want to talk to you about something that annoys the hell
out of me.

I’m talking about the Leetcode grind.

For those who might not be familiar with the term, the Leetcode
grind refers to studying for you interviews by simply attempting
to solve every problem (or as many problems as possible) on
Leetcode in the hopes that you will see something you recognize
in your interview.

If you’ve ever been to r/cscareerquestions, you’ve certainly
heard of the grind:

(If you don't see images below, click ""Display images"")

( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/8ku9do098diohxg7e3/drieh0hq9p6wr/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkZW50cy5ieXRlLWJ5LWJ5dGUuY29tL3JlY3Vyc2lvbi1zcC8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1icm9hZGNhc3QmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249b2N0MTgmdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9ZW1haWw1 )

So why does this bug me so much?

Because it is the most goddamned inefficient way I’ve ever heard
of studying.

Grinding problems on Leetcode theoretically exposes you to a lot
of problems so that you can memorize solutions and maybe see
those same problems in your interview. But simply going through
tons of problems isn’t a good way to memorize stuff.

And even so, memorization is a horrible strategy.

Memorization focuses on covering as wide a breadth of problems as
possible and hoping that you will be able to extract the
information you need when the time comes.

Because here’s the thing… there isn’t a set scope of knowledge
for your interviews. There aren’t a specific set of problems that
you’re supposed to memorize because THAT ISN’T THE POINT.

Rather, the purpose of an interview is to demonstrate your
ability to solve problems you haven’t seen before. So why not
study that?

The short answer is that people don’t know how. It takes a lot of
work to figure out how to actually problem solve effectively
rather than simply memorize solutions…

But…

The people who learn how to problem solve are the ones who
succeed.

The people who learn how to problem solve are the ones who never
worry about being asked a problem they haven’t seen before
because they know how to find a solution.

The people who learn how to problem solve are the ones who can
relax at the end of the day knowing that they’ve studied enough.

Now learning how to problem solve isn’t an easy task. But that’s
why I created Byte by Byte.

I created Byte by Byte because I was fed up with all the bad
information out there.

I created Byte by Byte because I wanted to show people there is a
better way to approach interview prep than simply grinding
Leetcode for months.

I created Byte by Byte because I knew that I could show people
how to study effectively, rather than wasting their time doing
useless crap.

But now that I’ve created Byte by Byte and I’ve given you the
resources that you need to do this, there isn’t any more that I
can do.

Now that these resources exist, it’s your turn.

I’m not going to babysit you and force you to do things the right
way if you don’t want to do them, but I am going to show you the
better way.

If you’re struggling with recursion, like so many are, Coding
Interview Mastery: Recursion ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/8ku9do098diohxg7e3/egfph7hk3rvw5/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkZW50cy5ieXRlLWJ5LWJ5dGUuY29tL3JlY3Vyc2lvbi1zcC8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1icm9hZGNhc3QmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249b2N0MTgmdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9ZW1haWw1 ) is
the better way.

In this course, I’ve taken one of the hardest topics out there
and broken it down so that you can learn how to solve these
problems step by step. I’ve shown exactly how I think about these
problems and shared all the tricks that I know.

Why wait? I don’t know when this course will reopen. I don’t know
what the price will be. But I do know that you will be way behind
everyone who started now.

Imagine how much further you could be in 6 weeks, 6 months, or 6
years if you didn’t have to figure this stuff out on your own.

I’ve already shown you the incredible progress that my existing
beta students made. That could be you…

But you have to decide. Now's your chance to determine where you
will be in the future. CIM: Recursion (

closes tonight at midnight.

I’m kinda an online course and coaching nut. Okay, not kinda, I
really am. As in spent almost $20k in the last year kinda nut.

There are people for who I’ll basically buy any course they
offer, regardless of the price.

However, I always still have questions. I don’t just buy things
blindly, I really want to know that something is going to work
for me before investing a large amount of money.

Now, in the same way, I imagine that
you, Sunny Khandare, might have questions
about CIM: Recursion ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/5qudo9ld2of7hz5xrz/8ghqhohgd6moz/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkZW50cy5ieXRlLWJ5LWJ5dGUuY29tL3JlY3Vyc2lvbi1zcC8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1icm9hZGNhc3QmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249b2N0MTgmdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9ZW1haWw0 ), so I wanted
to take some time during this email to answer some of the most
common questions I’ve been receiving.

The timing doesn’t work for me. I won’t be able to attend the
live calls. Should I still join?

Yes it’s true, you may get more out of this course if you are
able to attend the live calls. However that does NOT mean that
you shouldn’t join if the scheduling doesn’t work for you. Every
call will be recorded and you have lifetime access to the course
material and all future updates.

However, I wanted to take this one step further…

Normally, if you aren’t able to attend classes, you don’t have
any good way to get your questions answered. And while I’ve taken
all the questions my beta students had and integrated them into
the course content, I’m sure new questions will come up.

But that’s why I’ve decided to include a course Slack channel for
the duration of the course. Even if you have to watch the
recording of the lesson later because you were off in la la land,
you’ll be able to ask all your questions. All you have to do is
post in slack and get all of your questions answered by me or one
of your peers.

How is this different than Coding Interview Mastery: Dynamic
Programming?

CIM: Dynamic Programming is a short course designed to be laser
focused on dynamic programming specifically. You do need to use
recursion to apply the FAST Method for dynamic programming, but
we don’t go over any of the details of recursion in that course.

This course, on the other hand, covers the full breadth of
recursion. There are tons of recursive problems that are
completely unrelated to dynamic programming and this course goes
deep into all of them.

If you’ve already joined, or are thinking about joining CIM:
Dynamic Programming, this course will cover all the prerequisites
so that you can really knock both recursion and dynamic
programming out of the park.

Are there any prerequisites for this course?

This is NOT a beginner course. In fact, I designed it
specifically that way.

There are so many beginner resources out there on recursion
already that teach the same things. Here’s how you do Fibonacci.
Here’s how you do Factorial. Here’s whatever other crap.

ENOUGH.

I built this course for the other people out there who, like me,
want to go a level deeper. Those who want to really understand
recursion so that they can knock their interviews out of the
park.

As a result, we’ll spend a brief amount of time making sure that
everyone is on the same page with the fundamentals, but we’re
going to quickly move onto the good stuff.

If you’ve never done recursion before, this isn’t the right
course for you. However, if you have at least a basic
understanding but want to go deeper, this course will help you do
exactly that.

Can I get a discount?

No.

A huge amount of time and effort goes into creating an awesome
course and I truly believe that it is worth the price (plus I
added a payment plan to make it even more affordable).

I understand that not everyone can afford this course, and that’s
okay. This course isn’t for everyone. There are tons of other
resources that you can learn from.

However, if you’re ready to commit and learn this stuff in the
most effective way possible, this course would be cheap at twice
the price.

How long do I have access to the course content for?

When you join any one of my courses, you will get lifetime access
to all of the content in the course, as well as any updates that
I make to the content in the future.

I know that sometimes life can get in the way and situations
change, so I’m not going to charge you again for the same course.
You’ll be able to come back and review the recordings any time
you want.

That being said, I will not be maintaining the Slack channel
forever. I can guarantee that it will be open for the duration of
the course and at least a month after, but beyond that point I
don’t know. If you do have questions, get them in before then :)

What if I join and this course isn’t right for me?

All of my courses come with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

I fully stand by all of my courses. However, if you join the
course and realize after going through the material that it isn’t
the right fit, you can email me and I’ll get you refunded right
away.

We’ve been talking a lot about recursion the last couple of days
because it’s so friggin’ important. Without recursion, there’s no
way you’re going to pass your interviews.

But even if you’d prefer to sit on the couch and watch Netflix
rather than actually get a job there, there is one recursive
pattern that you should know.

This pattern comes up over and over again in so many different
places. Understanding this core pattern can help you find the
brute force solution to a huge range of questions.

The pattern? Selection.

Of course, we’re going to cover this in great detail in Coding

Yesterday I shared something that I’m really excited about with
you. CIM: Recursion ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/k0uqk7rq0ku6h383wz/reh8hohq0dm69/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkZW50cy5ieXRlLWJ5LWJ5dGUuY29tL3JlY3Vyc2lvbi1zcC8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1icm9hZGNhc3QmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249b2N0MTgmdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9ZW1haWwy ) is open
again!

See, this wasn’t just a little side project for me. I didn’t
build it because I thought it would be easy and I have so much
free time. I built it because I truly believe that people need
this information.

In fact, just in the last week, I’ve received 12 different emails
from 12 different people specifically asking for my help with
recursion, like this one:

(If you don't see images below, click ""Display images"")

( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/k0uqk7rq0ku6h383wz/0vuwh9hmde2l0/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkZW50cy5ieXRlLWJ5LWJ5dGUuY29tL3JlY3Vyc2lvbi1zcC8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1icm9hZGNhc3QmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249b2N0MTgmdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9ZW1haWwy )

Not only that, but I can remember my own experiences. My own
experiences not understanding recursion. My own experiences
interviewing and feeling like everyone around me is so much
smarter than me…

It’s not a particularly good feeling.

So I wanted to create a course that would really help people.

Not some collection of random recursive problems for you to
memorize.

Not some mathy crap that you have to learn.

Not some vague directives about finding the base case or breaking
the problem into subproblems.

No...

I wanted to develop a truly bulletproof system that anyone could
follow to approach any recursive problem.

So I studied. I dug deep in hopes of finding the answers.

I read books and blog posts. Wikipedia articles and study guides.
I dug and dug and you know what I found?

Nothing. No one had figured this out.

However, as I continued to search, patterns started to emerge.
Over the course of my study, I’ve combed through literally dozens
of recursive problems, looking for something.

This course ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/k0uqk7rq0ku6h383wz/8xiqhohgldore/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkZW50cy5ieXRlLWJ5LWJ5dGUuY29tL3JlY3Vyc2lvbi1zcC8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1icm9hZGNhc3QmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249b2N0MTgmdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9ZW1haWwy ) uncovers the secrets
I found. Because, as it turns out, there is a secret.

But when I discovered this, I couldn’t help but wonder, “will
this work for anyone else or just me?”

Part of the reason why there is so much bad information out there
is the sheer number of people who got a couple job offers and
decided to write a blog post about what they did. Not that
there’s anything wrong with that - I think it’s great that the
tech community shares so openly - but it’s not always the best
advice.

So I decided to do what I always do: Test my hypothesis.

Does this technique work just for me or other people as well?

Let me tell you…

…I was blown away by the results!

Students had their understanding of recursion double overnight.
They learned to systematize their thinking about recursion. They
learned how to understand problems that had never made sense to
them before

And that’s just the start. Today, I want to share with you a
couple stories of the results that people had going through the
course.

Ashish had so little confidence in his ability to solve recursive
problems, he could maybe solve 1 out of 10. He hasn't completely
figured it out yet, but he has the tools to do it! Here’s what he
had to say:

When this course started, I can say I was 20-25% confident. Not
confident. I was not at ease with recursion. I can solve maybe 1
problem partially out of 10 problems. But as soon as the course
kept on progressing, this confidence level raised to
approximately 30-35%. Now... I can attempt all the questions, and
I can solve at least 60% of them.

And the examples you have gave, the homework exercises, were
really helpful. Because each example exercise covered some form
of pattern, which you can apply to certain problems. So I found
that very helpful.

Julian came into the course more experienced than most, but still
found many new things to learn:

I didn't realize that it's possible to be so systematic about
recursion. Now, here's the thing, you throw a recursion problem
at me, I'm going to figure it out. I had done it enough that I
have a feel but it never really occurred to me to think about it
in a systematic way.

I [also] ended up being exposed to considerations of complexity
of recursion so many times that I got surprisingly comfortable
ballparking what the complexity is. And that's something I'd
avoided. I have overall in terms of problems, I have a moderately
good sense of how to compute complexity, but it's something that
I've been kind of pushing off to focus on at a later point. But
I'm really glad that I was able to figure that out with regards
to the recursion because that's one of the more, I guess tricky
places where you need to compute that.

Mothi discovered how knowing the specific patterns to use when
you get stuck in your interview can make it much easier to get
back on track:

The patterns made it so even if today I forget, if I go and see
the class and the set of problems, then I automatically learn,
""Okay. if these kinds of problems and I can relate with
selection."" It was very specific. That was really helpful. Online
there might be some 10 sets of questions or recursion problems,
but the categorization was missing. But this was somewhat more
narrowed down, that I felt it's helpful.

And these are just a few of the successes that students had going
through the beta course.

With successes like these, I’m so excited to finally be able to
make this course available to everyone.

Imagine if one of these was you. Imagine if you had started this
course 6 weeks ago where you could be right now

Well in 6 weeks this could be you, but you have to get started!

I want you to picture something for a second.

You arrive on Google’s Mountain View campus for your interview.
It’s a beautiful, sunny day, like always.

(If you don't see images below, click ""Display images"")

( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/75ug9kwgn9b8hm4e9l/9qhzhnhgx76e6/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkZW50cy5ieXRlLWJ5LWJ5dGUuY29tL3JlY3Vyc2lvbi1zcC8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1icm9hZGNhc3QmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249b2N0MTgmdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9ZW1haWwx )

You walk along the shady, tree-lined path into the super modern
building. Your host meets you at the entrance and takes you down
the hall, past the game room with ping pong tables and
Xbox-playing engineers, through the cafe with it’s mountains of
free goodies, and into your interview room.

Then you wait.

A few minutes pass before your interviewer finally shows up.
You’re nervous, but you know what you have to do.

As soon as your interviewer arrives, you’re on your game. You
answer one question, then another. That interviewer leaves and
another arrives. You’re doing great.

After a break for lunch you have one more interview. You’ve done
awesome so far, you just have to clinch one last interview.

Your interviewer arrives and asks you one simple question:
“Generate all the permutations of a list.”

Shit.

Recursion has always been your weak spot… but you had figured you
would be okay. I mean everything you learned in school about
recursion was so basic, right? You got that down.

But this is different. This is hard. You never learned this crap.

You’re so close to clinching this interview. So close to
receiving that coveted acceptance… but no. Not this time.

You fumble, grasp for the ball, and then drop it… mere inches
from the endzone.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. Recursion doesn’t have to be
the thing standing in the way of you and your dream job.

That’s why I’m so excited today to reopen Coding Interview
Mastery: Recursion ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/75ug9kwgn9b8hm4e9l/38uphkhqrw2k2/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkZW50cy5ieXRlLWJ5LWJ5dGUuY29tL3JlY3Vyc2lvbi1zcC8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1icm9hZGNhc3QmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249b2N0MTgmdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9ZW1haWwx )!

Let’s rewind for a second. What if you had signed up for CIM:

You head into the same interview, but now you’re prepared…

Over the last 6 weeks, you’ve unlocked the secrets that no one
teaches you about recursion and you’re ready to tackle any
recursive problem with ease.

You’ve discovered the 6 “cheat codes” that can unlock any
recursive problem. Armed with these powerful strategies, you know
that you can find a solution to any possible recursive problem
that might be asked.

You’ve learned to X-ray any recursive code to expose it’s hidden
meaning, allowing you to understand even the trickiest solutions.

You’ve seen the one trick that you can use to compute the time
complexity of any recursive problem in 30 seconds or less.

And that’s all just the start. With the skills you’ve acquired,
you’re confident about your interview.

You go into your interview at Google and…

...it’s easy.

You cruise through each problem, barely needing to stop and think
about it. It’s as if the solutions are forming themselves in
front of you.

You feel good.

Your interviewers feel good.

The day after your interview, you get a call offering you the
job!

Imagine how that would feel…

You’re set for life.

Not only are you making a comfortable 6-figure salary…

Not only do you have all the perks of working at one of the
richest companies in the world…

Not only do you have the opportunity to work on projects that
will change the future...

...you have the security of knowing that employers will fight
over you for the rest of your life. After all, who doesn’t want
an “ex-Googler” on their team?

But…

Before you can do any of this, you have to master recursion (

They freeze up and struggle to make,"[<p>Hey Sunny Khandare -

The most common concern I hear from people is that they see a
problem and they look at a problem and they don’t know where to
start. They freeze up and struggle to make progress.

Do you know why everyone has so much trouble?

They think that they’re supposed to immediately come up with the
optimal solution. They fear that if they even consider less
efficient alternatives it will make them look incompetent.

But that’s not true! You know what makes them look incompetent?
Not coming up with a solution at all.

Sometimes there is no better solution than brute force anyway.
Sometimes you can find ways to optimize your brute force solution
or it inspires you to think about the problem in another way.

And even if you don’t come up with anything better, coding up
something is INFINITELY better than nothing.

Now I want you to try this for yourself. Don’t worry, it’ll only
take about 10 minutes.

* Pick a problem that you’re struggling with. If you don’t have
one, just pick a somewhat tricky problem, like this one (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/n4ukvp5k9vaquxz4v6/z2hghnh7m0mro/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ieXRlLWJ5LWJ5dGUuY29tL21hdHJpeHByb2R1Y3QvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9YXV0b3Jlc3BvbmRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1uZXctc3Vic2NyaWJlcnM= )

* Solve the problem any way you can
- It doesn’t have to be efficient. If you’re trying to compare
values in two arrays, by all means compare every value to every
other value
- If you get stuck, just work through the problem by hand and see
if you can translate your manual work into an algorithm
- No need to code it up as long as you understand how you could
code it up

How did that go? I definitely recommend you take the time to try
this technique out. By always finding a brute force solution
first, you are guaranteed to have something to show your
interviewer. No more having to stress out about whether you can
solve the problem.

Best,

Sam

Sometimes when heading to an interview, I used to worry about the
most ridiculous things happening.

Like forgetting to wear pants. Or the interviewer screaming at me
for 45 minutes. Or having to solve a problem in front of an
auditorium of people.

I mean some people have had crazy stuff happen to them, right?

Like this Redditor who was asked if they’d ever stolen anything
and had to make up a story about stealing a toaster (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/r8uo756op7bohe5en4/6qheh8h2r0dz4/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS9yL0Fza1JlZGRpdC9jb21tZW50cy84ZzA2aG8vd2hhdF93YXNfeW91cl93b3JzdF9pbnRlcnZpZXdfZXhwZXJpZW5jZS9keTd1dmwzLw== ).

(If you don't see images below, click ""Display images"")

Or this poor poster who said that their favorite sports team is
“basketball” ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/r8uo756op7bohe5en4/5quvh7h9xlzqe/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS9yL0Fza1JlZGRpdC9jb21tZW50cy84ZzA2aG8vd2hhdF93YXNfeW91cl93b3JzdF9pbnRlcnZpZXdfZXhwZXJpZW5jZS9keTd6aGE1Lw== ).

Or this person who unwittingly participated in the ice bucket
challenge ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/r8uo756op7bohe5en4/qgi8h7h6wq0wg/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS9yL0Fza1JlZGRpdC9jb21tZW50cy84ZzA2aG8vd2hhdF93YXNfeW91cl93b3JzdF9pbnRlcnZpZXdfZXhwZXJpZW5jZS9keTgwNDlnLw== ).

Now, I highly doubt any of these things will ever happen to you.
They may be amusing stories, but they’re about one in a billion.

The scary part is that what will mess up your interview likely
won’t be some crazy circumstance. In fact, it will be what you’ve
already studied.

Simply, you’ll be screwed by not knowing interview topics as well
as you should.

Knowing strategies to get you unstuck can only get you so far.
The techniques we discussed on Tuesday will get you a long way,
but not if you don’t really understand the underlying topic.

Some topics, such as recursion, are just not taught at the level
that you need to know them for your interview.

So-called “teachers” convince you that you know these topics
because they focus on basic problems that anyone can solve. “If
you can solve Fibonacci, you know recursion!”

But then you get into the interview and they ask you the real
questions. The ones that no one prepared you for.

And it’s like someone dumping a bucket of ice water on your head.

This is why I’m so excited to be sharing my new course with you
next week. Make sure you watch for Monday’s email.

In the course, I’m going to show you exactly what your teachers
never will. You’ll learn advanced recursion strategies so that
you can solve any problem with ease.

Best,Sam

In fact, I&#39;ve found through working with","[<p>Hi Sunny Khandare -

Yesterday I told you about the #1 thing that people screw up in
their interviews: They don’t know what to do if they get stuck.

In fact, I’ve found through working with dozens of students that
many people don’t even know how to approach a new problem.
Rather, they simply go into the interview and hope that a
solution magically appears to them.

This is NOT a good strategy.

If your interviewer knows what they’re doing, they will
specifically ask you a question where the solution is nonobvious.
That doesn’t mean you have to be a genius to be able to solve it,
but you do have to have a structured approach.

When you see a problem that you don’t recognize, what is your
plan? Here are 10 strategies to keep in your back pocket in case
you get stuck during your interview.

------------------------------
1. Find a brute force solution
------------------------------

There’s probably one reason above all others that causes
candidates to get stuck finding a solution: They try to
immediately find an optimal solution.

I’ve discussed starting with brute force solutions (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/reh8hoh5qdn7x/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnl0ZS1ieS1ieXRlLmNvbS9icnV0ZS1mb3JjZQ== ) in the past, but it bears
repeating. It is very easy to go down different rabbit holes when
trying to find an optimal solution and finding a brute force
solution always gives you a grounded place to come back to. Even
though it may not be a great solution, if you can’t find a better
solution, it gives you something to fall back on.

The brute force solution also gives you a jumping-off point to
optimize your code. With a brute force solution, it is often easy
to see places in which you are doing repeated work or otherwise
slowing down the execution.

After finding the brute force solution, you can use Gayle
Laackmann McDowell’s BUD optimization (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/92ugdqwgkdbnhllm32/8kuqhoh5gdk3k/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2xpZGVzaGFyZS5uZXQvZ2F5bGUyL2NyYWNraW5nLXRoZS1pbnRlcnZpZXctc2tpbGxzLWNvZGluZy1zb2Z0LXNraWxscy1wcm9kdWN0LW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtaGFuZG91dHM= ), which stands for bottlenecks,
unnecessary work, and duplicated work. By identifying places in
your code that are slowing everything else down, you can find
ways in which to optimize the code.

For example, if you’re looping through an array and for each
element, you need to look up that element in another array, you
have an O(N * M) time complexity, if N and M are the lengths of
the two arrays. However, if you put the second array into a set,
you get a lookup time of O(1), so your time complexity improves
to O(N).

Finding a brute force solution is incredibly valuable, because it
helps you understand the problem better and ensures that you have
a solution.

-------------------------------
2. Fully understand the problem
-------------------------------

It is shocking to me how many people will start trying to solve
an interview problem without really understanding what they’re
supposed to do.

In fact, when evaluating new coaching clients, I always ask them
to simply print a linked list in reverse order. This should be a
very simple task, but many people miss the core directive, which
is to print the list. I often find people trying to return a
reversed list or other such things. However, that is NOT what I
am asking and can be significantly more difficult.

When problems are more complicated or confusing, I often find
that people will spend a few minutes trying to understand the
problem, but eventually give up and figure they’ll just start
solving it. That’s a critical mistake, though. How can you solve
a problem when you don’t know what you’re solving?

There are a couple things that you can do if you’re struggling to
understand a coding interview question. The first is to simply
ask more questions of your interviewer. Ask them to show you an
example or clarify any specific points on which you’re unclear.
Don’t feel bad about asking a lot of questions. It’s their job to
make you understand what to do.

You can also work through a few examples. Look at what the inputs
and outputs are. What is the function signature going to be?
Explicitly defining these parameters can be very helpful in
thinking about the problem. For example, if you’re writing a
recursive function, it’s way easier to figure out the base case
when you know what the return type should be.

-----------------------------------
3. Work through the problem by hand
-----------------------------------

Not sure how to solve the problem in a coding interview? Well can
you solve the problem yourself without writing any code? If you
understand the problem thoroughly, you should be able to answer
it. And if you can solve it by hand, you can solve it with code.

Let’s consider the example of determining whether a string is a
palindrome. Say I give you the string “acaramanamaraca”. Is it a
palindrome? Go ahead and decide.

How did you solve it? Did you compare the first and last letters,
then the second and the second-to-last and so on? Did you reverse
the string and then compare them? There are several different
ways that you can determine if a string is a palindrome by hand.

And now that you’ve done it by hand, can you write code to do the
same thing? In the two example solutions that I described, I
basically explained an algorithm that you can use to solve this
problem by hand. And that means it’s easy to write code to solve
it.

The key with this technique is just to be as detailed and
specific as possible when solving it by hand. If you say “oh I
just know it’s a palindrome”, then that’s not very helpful. How
do you know? If you’re struggling to think about it, pick a
larger input to solve by hand. Something that you can’t do in
your head.

For example, if I asked you to multiply two numbers, it would be
silly to use the example of 3*4, since presumably you have that
memorized from doing multiplication tables in elementary school.
A far better example would be 14235 * 2512. With this, it is very
unlikely that you’ll be able to do it in your head so you have to
write it out. This will help you identify the “algorithm” that
you’re using.

------------------------------------------------------
4. Brainstorm different data structures and algorithms
------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes the easiest way to approach a coding interview question
is to take different common solutions and see if any of them
apply. We can do exactly this in coding interviews by
brainstorming different data structures and algorithms and seeing
if any of them are a good fit for our problem.

Let’s say that we have a problem that involves strings. For
example, maybe we want to all the strings in an array that have a
certain prefix. Let’s brainstorm:

* Just keep the strings in the array. We iterate through the
array and just check the prefix of each string.
* Add all the strings to a hashmap with mappings for each
possible prefix. That might work but there are a lot of
possibilities.
* We could sort the array of strings. That might make things
easier.
* Maybe we could do some sort of tree structure?
* Speaking of trees, what if we used a trie?

From this basic brainstorm, we’ve come up with multiple valid
possibilities. In this case, the problem that we’re looking at
does have many possible solutions, so that’s to be expected. Even
if we only had one way to solve the problem, though, this may
help elucidate ways in which we can approach it.

The key is that no idea is too dumb when you’re brainstorming.
You’re doing this in front of your interviewer, so the temptation
is to try and sound smart, but you can very easily shoot yourself
in the foot by doing this. If you filter yourself while
brainstorming, you may miss key insights.

Put everything down on the whiteboard and then see if anything
jumps out at you. Can you make any clear connections? This
technique is great for sparking ideas.

--------------------------------------------
5. Consider all the information you’re given
--------------------------------------------

Lots of times, our interviewers give us clues as to how we should
think about a problem. By giving us details about how the input
is formatted or any restrictions on the input, they are subtly
hinting at how to view the problem.

For example, let’s say that we wanted to find a value in a sorted
matrix. If we know that the rows and columns of the matrix are in
sorted order, that gives us a big clue for how we can solve the
problem.

Without that information, we’re fairly limited in how we can
approach this problem. Our best bet would be to just iterate over
every value in the matrix to see if the value we’re searching for
exists. However, we have a big clue, which is that our matrix is
sorted.

Knowing the matrix is sorted, we have algorithms to help us deal
with that. There’s binary search and we can also consider other
properties of our matrix. For example, since both rows and
columns are sorted, if we pick an arbitrary cell [i, j], any cell
and is going to have a value less than cell [i, j].

From the information given, if you’re stuck, you can simply take
some time to extrapolate everything you can. If the array is
sorted, what does that mean? If the input is in tree format, how
can we use that to our advantage? Look for these clues.

-----------------------
6. Simplify the problem
-----------------------

My favorite types of problems to ask as an interviewer are
problems that have a lot of moving pieces. These force the
interviewee to consider not only each part of the problem, but
how all of the different components interact with each other.

As an interviewer, this is great because I get a better idea of
an interviewee’s mental model. As an interviewee, however, it can
be difficult. Whenever you see a problem that has a lot of
different stuff going on, a good starting point is to consider a
simpler problem.

Let’s say that we want to find the path through a matrix with the
greatest product. This is a moderately difficult problem, but it
is complicated even more if you consider that values in your
matrix can be negative. Since multiplying negatives cancel each
other out, this problem gets pretty tricky pretty fast.

But here’s the thing. The solution is not fundamentally different
than solving the problem for only positive numbers. If you get
the solution for solely positive values, then it is relatively
easy to extend the solution to include negative numbers as well.

Similar to first working through a brute force solution, solving
a simpler version of the problem gives you a really good starting
point from which to build out your solution. It is often simply a
matter of handling additional input values and adding some
conditionals. Once you have the framework, this is easy to do.

------------------------------------------
7. Break down the problem into subproblems
------------------------------------------

In addition to simplifying problems, you can also just ignore
parts of the problem when you’re initially coming up with a
solution. This is my favorite technique when people do it right.

When you are asked a problem and are trying to come up with a
solution, ask yourself the following question: “Is there any
function that, if I had access to it, would make it significantly
easier to solve this problem?”

Oftentimes, you will find that there is an obvious function that
dramatically simplifies the problem. Consider the example of
printing a linked list in reverse order. There should be two
obvious functions that would simplify this problem:
reverseLinkedList() and printLinkedList(). If we already had
these functions, our solution becomes trivial.

void printReversedLinkedList(Node linkedList) {

linkedList = reverseLinkedList(linkedList);

printLinkedList(linkedList);

// optionally, we can reverse our linked list again to return
it to the original state

}

Our code really can’t get much simpler than that. And now that we
have our top-level function laid out, we can focus on
implementing each of these functions individually. This won’t
necessarily be trivial – reversing a linked list is a bit tricky
– but it will be a hell of a lot easier than what we were doing
before.

The key with this technique is that by breaking down the problem
into smaller components, it is much easier to see how to solve
the problem. You can start by just assuming that you have a
function that does X. Now you only have to worry about doing all
of the other things. This abstraction makes it much easier to
reason about the problem.

And this technique also has an ancillary benefit. If you don’t
finish writing all of the code, it is still clear that you know
what you’re doing. If you choose to use a helper function, you
should implement that last. By implementing the core code first,
it is clear you know what’s up, and if you run out of time to
implement the helper function, chances are that was something
that would be pretty easy to do anyway. This is a great way to
compensate for lack of time/speed in an interview.

-------------------
8. Take a step back
-------------------

Going down a rabbit hole is one of the easiest ways to get stuck
in a coding interview. However, it’s not always obvious in the
moment that you’ve even gone down a rabbit hole in the first
place. That’s why I recommend that whenever you find yourself
starting to get stuck in a coding interview, you take a moment to
step back and look at the big picture.

Let’s say that we realize that we need a function that stores
value mappings. For example we have something like int -&gt; string.
Our initial solution might be to create a HashMap to store these
values. That would seem to be the logical thing.

However, we later discover that all of the integer keys are each
of the values from 0-n and we are going to want to be able to
iterate over the keys in order. Now our HashMap doesn’t seem so
great, right?

However, I can’t tell you how many people I see who will just
take what they already have and try and force it to work. They’re
trying to put a square peg in a round hole. You can do it, but
it’s a lot of work.

First they have to get a list of all of the keys in the HashMap,
then they have to sort it, and then they have to iterate over it.
And that’s not to mention the extra work of putting everything
into a HashMap in the first place.

If they just used an array, it would be so much easier.

However, this is not always obvious. We tend to think about
problems in an iterative way, building up to a solution. That
means that if we don’t stop to think carefully about what we’re
doing, we may end up doing a lot of unnecessary work.

Taking a step back is simply taking a moment to think about what
we’re doing at a high level and confirming that it is, in fact,
the best way that we could be accomplishing that task. You may be
surprised how often you don’t realize that there is a vastly more
efficient approach.

------------------------------------
9. Collaborate with your interviewer
------------------------------------

Many people see interviewing as a battle. It’s you versus the
interviewer. You’re trying to get the job and they’re trying to
take it away from you. You want to succeed and they want you to
fail.

This is one of the most destructive things that you can think in
your interview. This is completely false and it can change the
tone of the interview to be combative, which isn’t fun for
anyone.

The truth is that your interviewer wants you to succeed. Their
goal is simply to make sure that you meet the standards that the
company has. If they’re being hard on you it’s because they’re
trying to make absolutely sure.

When you’re stuck on a problem, you can get feedback from your
interviewer. The more you talk out loud in your interview, the
more they will already know what’s going on, too, so the more
they will be able to help you.

One of my favorite phrases to use in an interview is simply,
“does that sound good to you?” When I come up with a solution and
I’m not sure if it’s the best, I’ll ask that question, which
gives my interviewer two options.

* If I’ve found a decent solution, they can say yes and suggest
that I start coding it up. This way I don’t waste any unnecessary
time trying to come up with an even better solution.
* If they’re not happy with my solution, they can say no and
suggest that I think about it a little more. This is helpful too
because, without really giving a hint at all, they are saying
that I’m not quite there yet.

Granted, not all interviewers are going to be quite so helpful,
but there is no harm in asking and it can make your life a lot
easier.

----------------
10. Ask for help
----------------

I’ve included this last because it’s definitely a last resort.
Most interviewers will mark you down for needing a hint in your
interview. However, if you’re stuck and not making progress, this
is better than just twiddling your thumbs. And it doesn’t
necessarily disqualify you from getting an offer.

When you’re really stuck and not able to proceed, you can just be
upfront with your interviewer. Tell them that you’re a little
stuck and ask if they can give you a hint. Chances are, they’ll
offer you up something that will help you keep moving in the
right direction.

The worst thing that you can do in your interview is to give up
rather than asking for help. In the real world, there are plenty
of opportunities to get help from others, but no company wants to
have a quitter on their team. If you just give up when faced with
a hard problem, that’s definitely not what they want.

You’re not going to use all of these strategies in every
interview. They’re simply not necessary.

Sometimes you’ll see a really easy problem and you won’t need to
use any of them. Sometimes you’ll get a really hard problem and
have to combine several strategies.

Regardless of the specific interview question, though, knowing
these strategies will make you bulletproof against even the
toughest questions.

So I want you to do something right now. Pick one of these
strategies and try it out for yourself right now. We went over a
ton of stuff today so start with just picking one. I guarantee
you’ll see a big difference.

Best,

Sam

As a kid, I took piano lessons. The next door neighbors all got to take lessons so god dammit","[<p>Hi Sunny Khandare -

I'm going to share with you one of the more embarrassing moments
from my childhood.

As a kid, I took piano lessons. The next door neighbors all got
to take lessons so god dammit I wanted to do so as well. All
told, I probably studied piano for 10 years and got respectably
good during that time.

Now if you’ve never studied any performing arts you may not know
this, but recitals are a fairly regular occurrence. Several times
a year, you get a chance to actually perform what you’ve been
learning.

In my case, my piano teacher had about 15 students, so we would
have a recital for all the students and their parents. That meant
on average you were performing for about 40 people.

Well, I get up there to perform the piece that I’ve been
practicing. Given the number of people, I’m pretty nervous,
despite having spent the last 6 months practicing and memorizing
the piece.

I start playing and everything is going well. I’m not really
paying attention to the audience, but I assume they’re enjoying
it.

And then…

I mess up.

Nothing horrible, but it causes me to stop for a second and
restart. I start playing again, but immediately I know something
is wrong.

I’m not playing the right notes.

I stop again.

I try to restart a second time and the notes are still wrong.

Now I’m starting to freak out a little bit, and I realize I have
no idea what to do. I don’t know what the notes are. In the
context of the piece, I can play it just fine from the beginning,
but I didn’t prepare for this. I can’t just start playing the
song at a random part in the middle.

At this point all eyes are on me. My face is red. I sit there for
a minute and then do the only thing I can do…

I start over.

Despite being over 2 minutes into a &gt; 4 minute piece, I go back
to the very beginning and play the whole goddamned piece again.

Luckily, the second time I made it through the piece without
having to stop, but I realized something critical. You have to be
able to self-correct if you get stuck. If I had simply practiced
starting at different points during the song, I would have been
fine.

When I interview people, I see one mistake more than any other.
It’s not lack of studying. It’s not a crappy resume. It’s not
failing to develop rapport with me.

The single biggest mistake that people make is that they have no
plan for what to do when they get stuck.

Like me in my piano recital, they are completely unprepared for
this eventuality. And getting stuck is guaranteed to happen in
your interview at one point or another.

Everyone gets stuck sometimes, but the difference between those
who succeed and those who fail in their interviews is their
ability to get unstuck.

That’s all there is to it. Rather than hoping that you manage to
make it through your interview without getting stuck on a
problem, those who consistently succeed have a plan for what to
do when things don’t go their way.

Tomorrow, I’m going to show you the 10 most powerful strategies I
know for getting unstuck in your interview. With these tools
under your belt you’ll be able to make it through even the
toughest interview questions without stalling.

But in the meantime, I’m curious. Hit reply to this email and
tell me about a time that you got stuck during your interview.
I’m interested to hear your story!

Best,Sam

Whether via email with a new subscriber to this list or someone who has been around for the last year and a half,","[<p>Hey Sunny Khandare -

Every day, I talk to people about careers in software
engineering. Whether via email with a new subscriber to this list
or someone who has been around for the last year and a half, or
in person with one of my coaching clients, I see all different
shades of software engineers.

However, every single software engineer that I talk to aspires to
the same thing: A job at a great company.

I love this. There are so many places on the internet that
attract software engineers that just want a job to get by.

Here’s a Reddit post from a year ago:

(If you don't see images below, click ""Display images"")

( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/7qh7h8h8qdzzk/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnl0ZS1ieS1ieXRlLmNvbS9jaW0tZHluYW1pYy1wcm9ncmFtbWluZy8= )

I find posts like this fascinating because of how they tend to
polarize people. On forums like Reddit, there are posts like
this, from someone who obviously gets the value of having a
meaningful job, and then there are lots comments of jealousy from
people wishing that they could have a job like that where they
don’t have to do any work.

I love the readers of Byte by Byte because you don’t think that
way. You know what you really want, whether it’s a Big 4 or a hot
startup. My job is just to show you how to get there.

However, here’s the problem. Just knowing what you want is not
enough. There are tons of people out there gunning for the same
jobs. While the number is probably a little skewed down, Google
has an acceptance rate of ~1%. That means out of 100
interviewees, you need to be the best.

When you’re interviewing at companies like Google, just having a
vague understanding of a topic isn’t going to cut it. You need to
understand every topic backwards and forwards.

This is why I created Coding Interview Mastery: Dynamic
Programming ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/75u7h8hp6o56g/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkZW50cy5ieXRlLWJ5LWJ5dGUuY29tL2R5bmFtaWMtcHJvZ3JhbW1pbmctc3AvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9YXV0b3Jlc3BvbmRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1ldmVyZ3JlZW4mdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9ZW1haWwz ). After seeing so many
of my students putting in tons of effort only to still fail, I
wanted to ensure that there was a better way to learn dynamic
programming.

With topics that counterintuitive, you might put in tens of hours
only to realize you’ve barely made a dent in it and you can still
only solve the most basic of problems. CIM: Dynamic Programming (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/o2ikhqhl6rd6z/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkZW50cy5ieXRlLWJ5LWJ5dGUuY29tL2R5bmFtaWMtcHJvZ3JhbW1pbmctc3AvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9YXV0b3Jlc3BvbmRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1ldmVyZ3JlZW4mdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9ZW1haWwz ) takes everything that you need to
know for your interview and packages in such a way that you can
not only quickly understand it, but easily remember it in the
heat of the interview.

If you’re serious about interviewing, you’re going to put in many
hours into studying and preparing. However, even with all the
hours you’re putting in, there are so many different topics that
it’s not like you’re actually spending a whole lot of time on any
one.

When you spend weeks on dynamic programming, that’s time that
you’re taking away from other topics that you need to study.
Remember that you need to be very strong on every topic to get
the job at Google.

Ultimately, as I talked about last week, this is an opportunity
to invest in yourself. While no one is forcing you to do so,
recognize how not making this investment will affect your life.
You will continue studying dynamic programming. Maybe you’ll
figure it out. Maybe you won’t. Maybe you’ll get the job. Maybe
you won’t.

But regardless of the outcome, you will invest large amounts of
your time. Time that no amount of money can bring back. Chances
are, you’ll realize later that you actually needed this course,
and you’ll have wasted time and then still spend the money to
purchase the course.

This is why you should invest in this course today (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/zefghnhrk3xkg/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkZW50cy5ieXRlLWJ5LWJ5dGUuY29tL2R5bmFtaWMtcHJvZ3JhbW1pbmctc3AvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9YXV0b3Jlc3BvbmRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1ldmVyZ3JlZW4mdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9ZW1haWwz ). Not tomorrow, not next week. The
longer you put it off, the more time you waste.

If you’re ready to get the job you’ve dreamed of and nail dynamic
programming once and for all, join the course here. (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/p9ukn6qkmnaqudmk5m/pxteh9h52zo2v/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkZW50cy5ieXRlLWJ5LWJ5dGUuY29tL2R5bmFtaWMtcHJvZ3JhbW1pbmctc3AvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9YXV0b3Jlc3BvbmRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1ldmVyZ3JlZW4mdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9ZW1haWwz )

So far I&#39;ve had 60+ students go through the course and the feedback has been very","[<p>Hi Sunny Khandare -

Yesterday I introduced you to my course, Coding Interview
Mastery: Dynamic Programming ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/zluwn90wknu7u7n9r5/6qheh8h657e3l/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkZW50cy5ieXRlLWJ5LWJ5dGUuY29tL2R5bmFtaWMtcHJvZ3JhbW1pbmctc3AvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9YXV0b3Jlc3BvbmRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1ldmVyZ3JlZW4mdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9ZW1haWwy ). So
far I've had 60+ students go through the course and the feedback
has been very positive. Multiple students had dynamic programming
finally click once they understood the FAST Method, even after
struggling with dynamic programming for weeks prior to joining
the course. That’s why so I’m thrilled to be making this
publicly available for the first time.

This course is specifically designed for anyone who has struggled
with dynamic programming in any capacity. It will help you learn
the system you need to effectively solve dynamic programming
problems correctly every time.

Today, I want to address a few of the questions that have kept
coming up about the course. If you have any other concerns that I
haven’t addressed, please don’t hesitate to reply to this email
and I’m happy to address them.

I already have your ebook. How is this course different?

After writing Dynamic Programming for Interviews, I got a ton of
great feedback including many people who wanted me to take the
content deeper. They felt like the book got them started on the
right track but they wanted something else to bring the concepts
home.

This course is my answer for those people. For anyone who wants
to build on the knowledge that they learned in the book, this
course is perfect.

However, the course is also great for people who have never read
my ebook. Reading the book is certainly not a prerequisite. The
course covers all of the same material that is included in the
book and then goes several levels deeper. I provide detailed
explanations and walkthroughs of each step of the FAST Method and
go through video solutions of 7 problems. I also include 7
additional practice problems.

On top of all of the added content in the course, I am also able
to provide much better support for those in my course. Because I
get so many emails every day, I have to prioritize where I spend
my time, and paying customers are certainly at the top of that
list. If you’re going through the course and have questions, I am
always only an email away.

How do I know this course will work for me?

I’ve had this experience myself of trying to decide whether to
invest in a course and wondering “is this going to work?” It’s a
tough decision, because you always feel like you’re in a unique
situation and even if it worked for other people, it probably
won’t work for you.

Well I’m here to tell you that that’s not true. We all like to
think that we’re special snowflakes, but it turns out that 90% of
the time, we’re all struggling with the exact same things. If you
ever listen to podcasts like the Dave Ramsey Show, where he takes
phone questions, you’ll notice after the first couple episodes
that all of the questions are just the same few questions
repeated over and over with different personal details.

And guess what?! The answers to those questions is always the
same.

Through my ebook and the ~30 beta students in my course, I have
tested the FAST Method with hundreds of people, and it works!
Even if you feel like you're in a unique situation, I promise
that the FAST Method will work for you too.

Here’s one of my students, Anmol, describing his experience with
the course:

[Coding Interview Mastery: Dynamic Programming] is the best among
everything that I have come across on the internet. Resources
like GeeksforGeeks, InterviewCake and Cracking Coding interview
are really good for interview preparation. I had gone through
most of them, but I was never confident and never really
understood how to solve DP problems before taking this course.

After going through the course and using other additional
resources (when needed), now I feel confident that I can tackle
dynamic programming problems in my interviews (even if I have not
seen that problem in the past). I am very comfortable using the
FAST method (especially the top-down approach). I am gaining more
confidence every time I go through the video lectures.

As you can see, going through CIM: Dynamic Programming massively
accelerated his progress on a difficult topic.

In fact, I’m so confident that you’ll find this course valuable,
that on top of everything else, I’m offering a 100% money back
guarantee. If you go through the lectures and still can’t crack
dynamic programming, all you have to do is email me and I’ll
refund you everything. There’s absolutely no risk to you.

Why should I buy this course when I can learn dynamic programming
for free?

As I talked about in my email from last week, I believe strongly
that everyone should invest in themselves. When it comes to
interviewing for jobs, there is a deadline. You have to learn
everything by the time when you scheduled your interview.

That means that time is not very abundant. There is a clear
limited quantity of time that you have available, and you need to
fit all of the studying that you want to do into that time. If
you don’t totally figure out a topic before your interview,
that’s it. It doesn’t matter to the company if you learn it
later, because all they care about is your interview performance.

Basically, you need to learn everything you will need for the
interview before you get into the room.

This course is an opportunity for you to trade money for massive
time savings. There are so many things that you need to prepare
for your interview that you can’t take weeks to learn dynamic
programming. Without this course, I see people struggle for weeks
and even months to really understand dynamic programming.

Do you really have that kind of time? This course reduces all of
the materials out there into 3 hours of video content. If you
spend an extra 7 hours practicing on your own, that’s 10 hours
TOTAL that you have to spend on dynamic programming. You’re
certainly welcome to try to learn it on your own, but this course
will allow you to quickly figure out dynamic programming and get
back to all of your other studying.

The bottom line is, if you’re ready to learn dynamic programming
once and for all, this is the course for you. If you’ve wasted
too much time not making progress, this course is for you. If you
want to get your dream job, this course is for you.

Over the last two days I’ve been telling you about why students
tend to struggle so much with dynamic programming. On Monday, I
showed you why dynamic programming is so hard and yesterday we
discussed why the most common approach to studying, memorization,
fails for dynamic programming.

So now that we fully understand the issue with dynamic
programming, we can figure out how to solve it.

The key to solving dynamic programming problems (or any other
problems) effectively is to develop a system for solving these
problems.

I find that people often view each problem in isolation. This is
certainly how memorization works. The problem with that, though,
is the overwhelming amount of information that you need to retain
to actually do well on your interviews.

However, if you have a system and look at each problem as a part
of a whole, you can see the threads that connect all the
different problems, making it easier to see how brand new
problems that you’ve never seen fit into the overall structure.

Systems also ensure that you never get stuck during your
interview. One of my readers described her interview experience
like this:

[There is] the panic state that comes when I get an unfamiliar
problem and the brain paralysis that accompanies it. I blank out
for what seems like a very long time, nothing comes out verbally.

Having a system, while it won’t get rid of interview nervousness,
means that you always know what your next step is. When in doubt
or if you ever get stuck, you simply have to fall back on the
next step in the system.

Now, dynamic programming can be pretty counterintuitive. If you
want to find the most efficient solution, then you have to start
with a brute force solution. If you want to find an iterative
solution, then you need to start with the recursive solution.

This can make developing a system difficult to figure out on your
own.

That’s why I’m so excited to share with you my course Coding
Interview Mastery: Dynamic Programming (
https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/o8ud9xgd69fwunp3l5/owhkhqhl6g4l9/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkZW50cy5ieXRlLWJ5LWJ5dGUuY29tL2R5bmFtaWMtcHJvZ3JhbW1pbmctc3AvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9YXV0b3Jlc3BvbmRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1ldmVyZ3JlZW4mdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9ZW1haWwx ).

Being able to effectively solve dynamic programming problems in
your interview is incredibly important. I have had multiple
students tell me stories of screwing up interviews just because
they couldn’t do dynamic programming.

This sucks. You put in so much time and energy to prepare for
your interviews, that the very last thing you want is to screw up
on a single topic.

In this course, you will learn about the FAST Method for solving
dynamic programming problems so that you can solve any problem
with ease, even if you’ve never seen it before. Rather than
giving you a large set of questions and solutions to memorize,
CIM: Dynamic Programming ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/o8ud9xgd69fwunp3l5/wxi2hghv9o3po/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkZW50cy5ieXRlLWJ5LWJ5dGUuY29tL2R5bmFtaWMtcHJvZ3JhbW1pbmctc3A_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1hdXRvcmVzcG9uZGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWV2ZXJncmVlbiZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbDE= ) will
walk you through exactly how to solve each problem in a way that
you can apply to many other dynamic programming problems as well.

Among other things, the course will teach you how to:

* Identify when to use dynamic programming, so that you know
exactly how to solve any problem in your interview
* Solve any dynamic programming problem, even if you’ve never
seen it before
* Find both a top-down and bottom-up solution, and decide which
is better so that you can ace your interview with the absolute
best solution
* Study with laser focus so that you retain everything you learn;
no more blanking during your interviews

If you’re someone who has always struggled with dynamic
programming, stop trying to figure it out on your own. As many of
my beta students have discovered going through this course
material, dynamic programming has finally clicked in a way that
it never had before.

I had gone through [InterviewCake, Geeks for Geeks, etc], but I
was never confident and never really understood how to solve DP
problems before taking your course.

- Anmol B.

You can spend hours and days figuring this stuff out on your own,
but it is going to be a long and slow journey. Let me help you
learn dynamic programming in 1/10th the time so that you can ace
your interview without breaking a sweat.

Hey Sunny Khandare -

Yesterday I told you the reasons why dynamic programming is so
difficult. It comes down to not properly learning how to solve
the problems and solutions that are difficult to fake.

So why is this a problem? People don’t really “fake” their way
through their interviews, right?

Now I’m not saying people cheat their way through their
interviews. I’m sure it happens but I doubt it’s a serious issue.
When I say they fake it, I’m saying that they make it through
interviews without understanding the underlying principles.

This is actually how most people study. They focus on memorizing
solutions.

When you memorize solutions, you get a quick and easy win. It’s
easy to fake your way through a lot of interview questions by
recognizing the similarities between the problem you get asked
and a problem that you’ve studied. As long as you remember the
solution, you can probably muddle through.

Therefore many people think that if they can just memorize enough
solution they will be able to pass their interview because every
problem will be similar to one they’ve seen before.

This is the lazy approach to studying. You can immediately get
started; all you need is a list of potential interview questions.
You don’t need a plan, you don’t need a teacher, you don’t even
need to fully understand the subjects that you’re studying.

However, as you’ve probably guessed by now, there are a lot of
flaws in this approach. I refuse to teach in this way because,
while you may see short term results, the gains taper off quickly
and it’s impossible to reach the level most people want to
achieve through memorization.

Among the flaws of memorization are:

* There are so many possible problems out there that it’s
unlikely you’ll ever see the same problem more than once. And
even if you do, you should tell your interviewer you’ve seen it
before ( https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/75ug9kwgn9b2u8qvpz/dpheh0hkve84q/aHR0cDovL2NvZGluZ2ZvcmludGVydmlld3MuY29tL3NlZW4tcXVlc3Rpb24tYmVmb3Jl ).
* When you memorize out of context, it can be really hard to
remember what you learned. And on top of that, you’re not
actually learning how to apply these skills, so you may see a
similar problem and not know how to solve it.
* Some categories of problems, like dynamic programming, seem
unrelated when you look at the solutions. You can only find the
connection when you understand how to solve the problems.

Hopefully by now, you’ve realized that memorization probably
isn’t a good approach for us to use with dynamic programming.
Simply put, just having seen solutions to dynamic programming
problems barely helps us at all when it comes to solving a
problem we haven’t seen.

Unless you understand the underlying theory of dynamic
programming, you will always go into interviews wondering, “what
if I can’t find the connection?” “What if they ask a dynamic
programming problem and I don’t even know to use DP?”

So if memorization won’t get us the results we want, how can we
effectively prepare for our interviews? Tomorrow, I’m going to
tell you how we can use a problem solving system to succeed in
our interviews.

Best,

Sam

As you know if you’ve spent any time preparing for interviews or
exploring the Byte by Byte blog, there are lots of challenging
topics that interviewers have to choose from when deciding what
questions to ask.

However, none quite so universally strikes fear into people’s
hearts as dynamic programming.

When I ask students what they struggle with most, I hear dynamic
programming over and over again.

(If you don't see images below, click ""Display images"")

If you have any experience with dynamic programming, then you
probably know that it’s hard. Unless you’re one of the lucky few
who naturally “get” dynamic programming, I’ll bet this is a topic
you’ve struggled with.

But why is it so difficult? If we can understand why dynamic
programming is so difficult, then we can potentially figure out
how to make it easier, opening up all the job opportunities that
were previously out of reach.

The problems with dynamic programming are actually twofold:

* Students rarely learn how to really solve these problems
* On the surface, all dynamic programming solution seem totally
different

When you don’t understand how to really solve these problems, you
are purely reliant on having seen similar problems before. And
I’m not talking about theoretical knowledge. I’m talking
specifically about understanding how to implement these
solutions. So many people I talk to say they understand the
theory but don’t know how to implement the solution.

Let me tell you something. If you don’t know how to implement the
solution, then you’re not going to pass your interview.

Not understanding how to implement solutions is also why all the
solutions look so different. On the surface they are, but if we
understand how to implement them, we can recognize that they’re
all implemented in the same way.

It’s this lack of full understanding and apparent dissimilarity
that makes dynamic programming so difficult. This is why it is a
great way for interviewers to test if you really know your stuff.
It also means you had better know it.

Unfortunately, however, most ways that students prep for dynamic
programming simply don’t work. Tomorrow, we’re going to see why
standard methods of preparing for interviews are flawed when it
comes to dynamic programming.

Best,

Sam

Unless you&#39;ve been living under a rock, I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ve noticed the sheer number of resources there are out there","[<p>Hi Sunny Khandare -

Today I want to tell you about a serious problem.

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, I’m sure that you’ve
noticed the sheer number of resources there are out there to help
you prepare for your interviews. There’s Cracking the Coding
Interview, Leetcode, Hackerrank, Coding Bat and so many more.

In theory, this is a good thing. There are so many resources to
choose from. But every one of them is flawed.

Every. Single. One.

Every resource that I’ve ever come across focuses on the “what”
of coding interviews.

What questions are they going to ask?

What topics should you prepare for?

What coding language should you use?

These are all useful and things that you need to know. But the
problem is that everyone stops there. They tell you the what, and
then you are left on your own to figure out the more important
piece: The “how”.

There is a big difference between knowing what something is and
how to do it.

I know what horseback archery is, but that doesn’t mean I’d be
able to do it without falling off the horse and simultaneously
shooting myself in the foot. Maybe I could figure it out on my
own…if I found a horse that could shoot a bow and arrow.

The same is true for coding interviews. There’s a big difference
between knowing what to do and knowing how to do it. And if you
don’t know the “how”, it’s very easy to metaphorically shoot
yourself in the foot.

I always have trouble deriving the DP solutions. Once I see the
solution everything makes sense. But it seems magical to come up
with it by yourself. It might help to have seen similar problem
before. But it is not very intuitive.

- Priyanka G.

This is the reason why I created Byte by Byte. I wanted to answer
the simple question of “how?”

How do I study what I need to know effectively so that I don’t
forget it in my interview?

How do I answer any question, regardless of whether I’ve seen it
before?

How can I interview successfully?

The FAST Method for solving dynamic programming problems is a
perfect example of the “how” in action. Rather than show you lots
of dynamic programming problems, I show you how to solve ANY
dynamic programming problem.

Unlike other resources, you don’t have to rely on memorizing
every possible solution to every possible problem, because you
know how to solve the problems.

Once you have the FAST Method under your belt, you no longer have
to worry about whether your interviewer will ask you a dynamic
programming problem you’ve never seen before. You know how to
solve whatever problem they ask, so tell them to “bring it on!”

After reading this e-book, I feel very confident that I can solve
any Dynamic Programming problem.
- Ravi V.

This is the power of learning “how”. Learning the “how” is the
best way that I know of to supercharge your coding interview
prep.

Tomorrow, we’re going to dig deeper on this topic and look at
dynamic programming in more depth, but in the meantime, I want to
hear from you! Reply to this email and tell me what you think is
the hardest thing about dynamic programming.

See you then!

Best,

Sam

Sam here from Byte by Byte. I’m so excited to see you joined my
email list!

Over the next few weeks, I’m going to guide you through the
entire interview prep process. By by the end you’ll be solving
interview problems like a pro. You’ll go from begging for a job
offer to having companies fight over you!

The techniques that I’m going to show you were developed over
years of work with dozens of students. When I first founded Byte
by Byte and started coaching back in 2016, I believed the
conventional wisdom. That the best way to get good at
interviewing was to drill practice problems.

That’s certainly what everyone else teaches. Leetcode has 750+
practice problems. Cracking the Coding Interview has 189. Other
sites have thousands more.

However, after seeing students fail interviews even after going
through hundreds of problems, I realized that rote practice was
not as effective as advertised. And when I dug deeper into my
students’ experiences, I found out exactly why.

After upgrading how I teach, my students’ results speak for
themselves. They’ve landed jobs at companies like Amazon, Uber,
Microsoft, Bloomberg, and more. And in these emails, I’m going to
help you do the same.

Tomorrow, I’m going to tell you exactly how everyone else is
getting interview prep wrong.

But first, have a quick request for you. Hit reply to this email
and answer me:

What is your biggest struggle right now preparing for coding
interviews?

I read every email, so your feedback is greatly appreciated.
Ultimately, my goal is to help you as much as I can, and knowing
your struggles helps me do that.

Talk again soon!

Best,

Sam

10 Years of Stack Overflow


Stack Overflow launched 10 years ago this month. We started the site to help 
developers find solutions to their coding problems. Today, it’s a standard part 
of every developer’s toolkit.

Over the last 10 years, three million of you have written 25 million answers 
to 16 million questions. It’s been amazing to see programmers help each other. 
And from the incredible Q&amp;A we built together to things like ourSalary 
Calculator <https:> and Stack Overflow for Teams 
<https:>, we look forward to continuing to help you.

We hope you enjoy this short video.

But more than anything, we want to say thank you. We couldn’t have gotten here 
without you.
